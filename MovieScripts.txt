Clouseau.
Yes, well, the first time
I ever heard that name...
...Clouseau was just a little nobody.
A police officer in some little village
far outside of Paris.
He was the village idiot
as far as I could tell.
Idiot, pull up.
Monsieur Dumont, you must
move your vehicle immediately.
I am so sorry, Officer Clouseau.
My chair, it won't move.
Here's your problem.
Your battery cable has come undone.
Let me help.
Let's see.
The positive to the negative.
The negative to the positive. There.
All right, you are ready to go.
All clear, keep it moving.
As chief inspector
of the Police Nationale...
...I hear many stories
of our officers in the field.
Clouseau generated many...
...many stories.
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.
You are under arrest
for the murder of Pierre Fuquet.
Pierre Fuquet?
The case is closed.
Needless to say...
... Clouseau did not qualify
for any advancement whatsoever.
I never thought for a moment
I would have any use for him...
...until that fateful day.
It was a perfect day for a murder.
France against China, with the winner
advancing to the finals.
I had been invited, as chief inspector
of the Police Nationale.
And because of my recent nomination
for the Medal of Honor.
I have been nominated seven times.
I have never won.
But still, seven nominations...
...that's something.
Anyway, the coach of
the French team, Yves Gluant...
... came out
for his customary ovation.
He raised his fist to the crowd.
On it:
The Pink Panther diamond.
It was quite the symbol of pride
and victory for the French team.
Gluant's girlfriend at that time...
... was Xania,
the international pop star.
They had been having
quite a stormy affair.
By the end of regulation time
the score was tied...
... and the game
went into sudden death.
For a patriotic Frenchman
and a true fan like myself...
... it was almost
too thrilling to believe.
And then...
... the miracle.
Yes! Yeah!
Yes!
Yes!
Yes!
And then, in front of a stadium
filled with people...
... Gluant collapsed...
... dead.
A poison dart in his neck.
And the Pink Panther diamond...
... had disappeared.
The newspapers fed on
Gluant's murder with a frenzy.
For them, the world had stopped.
For me...
... it was an opportunity
for my greatest triumph.
I know what we need
for the Gluant case.
- What?
- An incompetent.
An unimaginative, by-the-book,
low-level incompetent...
...who will plod along,
getting nowhere...
...with the media
watching his every step.
And while he is getting nowhere...
...I will put together the finest team
of investigators in France...
...and we will hunt down the killer,
retrieve the Pink Panther diamond...
...and then the Medal of Honor
will be mine.
And who is this incompetent?
Oh, I think I know
the perfect man for the job.
Find him and bring him to Paris.
His name is Clouseau.
Good morning, mademoiselle.
I'll be right with you.
The minister of justice sent around
a new picture of himself...
...but it was bigger than
Chief Inspector Dreyfus' picture.
So the chief inspector
had a larger one made.
You'll find that Paris
can be a very political place.
Yes, politics. Where greed
wears the mask of morality.
That's good. Did you say that?
Yes, I did.
- Could you help me down?
- Oh, yes, of course.
Oh, yes. Here, just... Perhaps...
- Yes, l...
- All right.
- Wait.
- Yeah.
Don't jump. Yes, that's good.
All right.
I think if you put
your leg right there...
- Okay.
- Yes. Okay.
Yes.
- I can't see anything.
- Maybe over here?
- Yes, okay.
- Okay.
Over here.
The inspector will see you now.
He'll be right with you.
Clouseau.
- Clouseau.
- He's coming in.
Good.
Officer Jacques Clouseau,
gendarme, third class.
- That had to hurt.
- No. No, not at all. No.
Clouseau, the reason
we called you here...
It is lovely weather we are having.
I hope the weather continues.
The area is secure.
Oh, thank you.
Clouseau, I have reviewed
your records, and it is clear to me...
...that a man of your talent
merits greater responsibility...
...than you have had
up to this point.
I have decided to promote you
to inspector...
...the highest rank of any officer
in the republic.
- Inspector?
- Exactly.
And your first case
is the Gluant murder...
...and theft of
the Pink Panther diamond.
- I am honored.
- Good.
Jacques Clouseau,
by the power vested in me...
...I hereby appoint you
full inspector...
...with all of the...
Here, if you would be so kind,
please.
Oh, here, take my pen.
Thank you.
One does not often see
the traditional French fountain pen.
I will cherish this forever.
No. It is not a gift.
That was given to me
by the mayor of Paris.
Well, then...
...I cannot accept this.
The press conference.
Yes. Clouseau, there is
a press conference...
...in just a few minutes
down the hall...
...to introduce you to the media.
We'll meet you there.
And, Clouseau?
Yes?
Good luck.
Good luck to you.
And where is the press conference?
Go under the arch...
...through the door on the right
and down the hall.
Well...
The area is still secure.
Thank you.
He's perfect.
Yes, we have definitely
found our man.
Why do I feel wet?
Because of the unique nature
of the crime...
...we have brought in a man
specially suited to the case:
Inspector Jacques Clouseau.
Inspector.
Inspector.
- Yes?
- Yes, what's your initial premise?
That Gluant did not
want to be killed.
Everything else follows
like liquid mercury...
...flowing down a... A...
A sloping thing.
How long do you think
it will take to find the killer?
Right now the killer is being
surrounded by a web of deduction...
...forensic science
and the latest in technology...
...such as two-way radios
and e-mail.
Assign a man to be his driver who can
report on his whereabouts at all times.
What kind of man?
A man who follows orders
and doesn't ask questions.
Inspector, do you know if the killer
was a man or a woman?
Well, of course I know that.
What else is there? A kitten?
Excuse me,
do you think it's possible...
...that the killer could be
watching you now?
Well, if I was a killer,
I would certainly be watching...
...and possibly taping
for later playback...
...because, you know, it's a big deal
to be talked about on TV.
But I have a message for the killer:
There is no place you can hide.
There is no place
you cannot be seen.
Killer, I will find you...
... because I am
a servant of the nation.
Because justice is justice...
... and because France is France.
- Bonjour, Nicole.
- Good morning, inspector.
Welcome to your new office.
You should probably start
by going through these files.
It is lovely weather we are having.
I hope the weather...
...stays this mild.
If the weather continues...
...we are in for a lovely summer.
The area is secure.
- Are you all right?
- Well, of course I'm all right.
And what is that?
- What?
- Nothing.
You should probably start
by looking at these files. You have to...
My leg, it crushed my leg!
Being an inspector,
you'll need some new clothes.
I can take your measurements
and have something sent over.
- Of course.
- Please remove your jacket.
Yes.
- Do you live by yourself, inspector?
- Yes, I do.
Do you get lonely?
No, not really.
Not since the Internet.
Well, that takes care of that.
And welcome to Paris.
Thank you.
Good morning, monsieur.
And you are?
Gilbert Ponton.
Detective, second class.
I've been assigned to work with you.
What qualifications do you have
for police work?
My family's done police work
in Paris for nine generations.
- And before that?
- We were policemen for 200 years.
- And before that?
- Immigrants from countries in Europe.
- All involved in police work.
- And before that?
Farmers.
So you are a little lamb who has
come to Clouseau for to learn.
Gilbert Ponton, I vow to teach you
everything I know about police work.
And together...
...we are going to catch a killer.
There.
The Chinese VIP box,
right on the edge of the kill zone.
The poison was Chinese.
Was Gluant ever in China?
Three years ago, he took a group
of French stars there...
...for some exhibition games.
Gluant was in China...
...the poison is from China...
...the Chinese are from China.
It may be too early to say for certain,
but I think our killer is Chinese.
Corbeille, I want you
on the next flight to Beijing.
Find out what Gluant did there,
who he saw, where he went.
Pacquette, I want a dossier
on every Chinaman in that box.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Inspector, it's awfully late and...
Oh, I'm just going over
these crime-scene photos.
- Don't you need some rest?
- Crime does not rest, Nicole.
It's true.
You see...
...I have waited a long time
to prove myself.
And I've been given
the opportunity of a lifetime.
And I intend to show the world
exactly who I am...
...and what I can do.
I must not fail.
You won't. I know it.
Thank you, Nicole.
- Nicole?
- Yes?
May I be very frank with you?
Of course.
You have put on a ton of weight.
Now, what I do
when I get a little heavy...
Never mind.
Would you like me to stay behind
and help you?
That is a generous offer, Nicole...
...but I am quite sensitive
to office gender politics.
And in today's world,
the slightest gesture...
...can be misinterpreted
as harassment.
And it is late, and I would prefer
not to put you or me...
...into that delicate situation.
Agreed?
Yes, I agree.
Well, let's seal it with a kiss.
And I'll get back to work.
I am going to be frank.
Since you are only a detective,
second class...
...your senses may not be as sharp
as my own.
And as I do not want a partner
who makes me duller...
...I have come up with a plan
to keep you as sharp as possible.
And what is that?
Intermittently, and without warning,
I will attack you...
...whenever and wherever
it is least expected.
In this way, I will keep you
vigilant and alert. Agreed?
Yes.
- Good one.
- Thank you.
Here we are.
"Do not open door
when light is flashing."
Excuse me.
Coming through. Thank you.
And I'm wondering if you... Yes.
I'm wondering if you saw, perhaps,
a person yelling.
Stop! Stop, stop!
Who are you,
and what the hell are you doing?
- I'm in the middle of an interrogation.
- The booth is soundproof.
She can't hear a word.
And in case you haven't noticed...
...you ruined my recording session.
Now, get out.
Unless you want to be charged
with obstruction of justice...
...you will let me interrogate Xania.
It's all right, Roland.
Hello, inspector.
I'm Xania.
You do not know this, but I am
intimately familiar with your work.
You are very kind.
Did you say that booth
was soundproof?
Yes.
Now, you were nearby
when Gluant was killed?
Yes, I ran out to be with him
after the team won.
Of course you did.
Now, a few hours
before the murder...
...six witnesses saw you repeatedly
striking the deceased and screaming...
What was it, Ponton?
"I am going to kill you.
I am going to kill you."
I was angry.
I caught him with another woman.
And this was after
he said he loved me.
You poor little angel waif.
After he cheated on me...
...I hated him.
- But I didn't kill him.
- Of course you didn't.
- You recently performed in China...
- Stop browbeating her!
Can't you see she's sexy?
Three months ago in Shanghai.
Can you think of anyone else
who might have hated Gluant?
- Bizu.
- The football star?
I was dating Bizu when I met Gluant.
He thought Gluant was a bad guy
for stealing me away.
- Lf you ask me, they were both...
- You, don't leave town.
But I'm flying to Montserrat
to record Rene Duchanel...
You will not leave town. I may want
to ask you a few more questions.
But I don't know anything.
About life, about love.
Yes, you little wet puppy.
But about the crime
you may know a lot.
Inspector.
Do I have to stay in town?
Because next week
I have something...
...vague to do in New York.
Well, if you absolutely have
to do something vague...
...feel free to go where you wish.
I can't take you to Bizu, but I can
take you to Monsieur Vainqueur...
...the team's assistant coach.
Well, I guess he's
the head coach now.
- You wanted to see me?
- You are Vainqueur?
Yes. And who are you?
I am Inspector Clouseau.
Perhaps you have heard of me.
No.
Don't write that down.
- What do you want?
- I am told that Bizu hated Gluant.
A lot of people hated Gluant.
Did you?
I spent six years under his thumb
being verbally abused every day.
Yes, I was not a fan
of Yves Gluant.
And now he is dead...
...and you have his job.
Ironic.
Not every death is a tragedy.
- And what was the...?
- Footsteps.
It's a young woman...
...30 to 35 years old...
...5'2", 5'4", brunette.
And she is wearing high heels.
Perhaps a bit too formal
for the afternoon.
And she has on...
...Chanel N5.
- Is anyone with you?
- No.
Do you have a pair of high heels
in that bag?
- No.
- Not even a small pair of pumps?
- No.
- Who are you?
I am Yuri, the trainer.
And what is it you do here,
Yuri the trainer?
I train.
So you are Yuri the trainer
who trains.
Do not leave Europe.
But I have to go to Asia.
Okay.
Do not leave Europe or Asia.
We have one match in Brazil.
All right.
Do not leave Europe, Asia
or the Americas.
- Okay.
- Where is this famous soccer player?
He is outside on the practice field.
Well, we shall see about Mr. Bizu.
I've got Bizu
in the interrogation room.
What's the plan?
I'm going to give him the
good-coplbad-cop routine.
You are the soccer player
known as Bizu?
- Yes.
- You were acquainted with Gluant?
- I'm glad he's pushing up daisies.
- He is not pushing up daisies.
He is dead.
It's an idiom.
You, sir, are the idiom.
Now, unless you want to spend
the rest of your life in prison...
...you will answer the next question.
Did you kill him?
I would have loved
to have killed him.
But some lucky bastard
beat me to it.
You disgust me.
I'll be right back.
Cigarette?
No.
Thanks.
Good for you.
Bizu...
...I know you didn't do it.
Someone else did,
and they are trying to set you up.
You'll help me?
Of course I'll help you.
Now, do you have any idea who
might have done this terrible thing?
His partner in those
stupid restaurants, Larocque.
Raymond Larocque,
the casino owner.
Gluant would steal money from
the restaurants and use it to gamble.
My guess is Larocque got fed up...
...and had him killed.
Bizu, I like you.
I'm going to help you.
You and I are going to make
a great team.
The good-coplbad-cop routine
is working perfectly.
You know, usually
two different cops do that.
You know what we do to prisoners
who don't cooperate?
We hook them up to the box.
What is the box?
Idiot. Like this,
I take one electrode...
...I put it here.
I take the other one...
...I put it...
So, what do you think?
Bizu is innocent.
How can you say that?
Gluant suspended Bizu.
He stole his girlfriend.
If it were me, I would have killed him
then and there.
That's exactly what Bizu did.
Ponton...
...a crime is like a jigsaw puzzle.
You have to have the jig
and you have to have the saw.
You have the jig, but no saw.
Where is your saw?
"Oh, Your Honor, I want to present
a case, but all I have is a jig.
Is that okay?"
What?
Nothing.
I thought you said:
No.
Strange.
Oh, it's you.
I hope you don't mind I let
myself in with the spare key.
- Oh, no, no.
- And, look.
I got your pants back from the tailor.
- Plus a spare.
- Good.
- Would you like some water?
- Yes, please.
You know, Nicole, this crime
is forcing me to use all my knowledge.
Everything I have learned in a lifetime
of investigating is coming into play.
Do you mind if I have these?
I haven't eaten.
Oh, please, go ahead.
Things are appearing in my mind
that I did not even realize was there.
And yet the in...
Oh, my God. The Heimlich!
The Heimlich!
Are you feeling better?
Yes, thank you.
You are so good at it.
Where did you learn that?
I used to practice on mannequins,
pillows...
...but frankly, it was the expression
on your face...
...that told me that you needed it.
Now, Ponton, what do you
have for me?
It seems you were right about Bizu.
He was just found dead...
...in the training facility locker room.
- Shot in the head.
- Was it fatal?
- Yes.
- How fatal?
Completely.
I want to talk to him now.
He's dead.
You there. Halt.
You are Yuri the trainer
who trains.
Yeah, that's right.
I am looking for a dead body.
Perhaps you can tell me where it is.
Oh, yeah. I heard it was
in the locker room.
You go down the hall,
make a right and two lefts.
You are finding
something amusing here?
I'll be honest with you. L...
I find your accent quite funny.
- Where are you from?
- From Russia.
Gluant recruited me
from the Russian military gym.
You need to work on your accent.
- What?
- What?
- What? What?
- What?
- What?
- I don't have time for this.
I have to solve a murder.
Please, tell me what you saw.
Well, I didn't see anything.
I was passing by the locker room.
It was late, past time
anyone should be there.
I heard movement on the other side
of the locker-room door.
I heard Bizu say:
"Oh, it's you."
And then there was gunfire.
Ponton, go to your databases.
I want to interrogate every person
in Paris with the name "You."
And, Ponton...
...don't you find it
a bit of a coincidence...
...that the body fell perfectly
within the chalk outline on the floor?
I think they drew
the chalk outline later.
We are dealing
with some kind of mastermind.
Ponton, I want to interrogate
this man Raymond Larocque.
Where is his casino?
Park it close by. Unless you want
to know what else is good for you.
You continue to surprise me,
inspector.
Get used to it, Ponton. With me,
surprises are rarely unexpected.
Yes, the weather is nice today.
Let's hope it continues.
Ponton, go find security.
Tell them I want to converse
with Mr. Raymond Larocque.
- You're not coming?
- Something has come up.
If the weather stays this mild,
we are all in for a treat.
- Place your bets.
- I am in law enforcement too.
Am I that obvious?
No, it's just that I have an ear
for such things.
Here is your mojito.
- Flame it.
- No more bets.
Impressive.
I will remember that.
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.
I am here on a very important case.
Boswell. Nigel Boswell.
Agent 006.
- Know what that means?
- Of course I do.
You are one short of the big time.
I, too, am on a very important case,
inspector.
So you understand
what I mean when I say...
...no one must know that I am here.
I have just slipped my
cell-phone number into your pocket.
Call me if you need any help.
I will, inspector.
Well...
...Monet. Very impressive,
Monsieur Larocque.
Very impressive,
Inspector Clouseau.
Please make yourself at home.
Now, how can I help you?
I am investigating the murder
of Yves Gluant.
Yves.
Fascinating man.
Would you happen to know
what he paid for the Pink Panther?
He inherited it.
It cost him nothing.
It cost him his life.
I would like to take a closer look
at your bowls.
- My what?
- Your bowls.
I would like to take a closer look...
...at your big brass bowls.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Han Dynasty.
- Very rare. Beautiful.
- I see you have an eye for antiques.
Some here are real
and some are copies.
I'm sure you can tell
which are which.
Second century. Very rare.
One should always handle
an antique vase from the inside.
Otherwise the oil from the hands
can damage the patina.
Pure alabaster.
Lovely.
That's odd. What I did,
I went like this, and then...
This is weird.
Why did you take out
a life-insurance policy on Gluant?
The insurance company won't pay
unless the murderer is caught.
And if it turns out to be me...
...they won't pay at all.
Do you understand?
But you stood to gain
from Gluant's death, didn't you?
Gain? What would I gain?
Gluant's share of the restaurants.
Oh, the restaurants
were a disaster.
Gluant was siphoning money out
faster than it came in.
My only consolation was he'd lose
the money gambling in my casino.
But after a while his losses
became so ridiculous...
...he promised me his ring
as collateral.
But someone had words
with Gluant...
...the night before he was killed.
- Didn't you?
- No.
You didn't threaten to break his legs
and then crush him into powder?
No.
Perhaps I saw that on TV.
Well, I can certainly think
of a better place for this.
That's my personalized
cell-phone tone ring.
Hello?
Yes, this is Inspector...
Yes, I could meet you.
In the restaurant?
Yes, of course. Right away.
Gentlemen, something has come up.
Please excuse me.
- Monsieur Larocque.
- Yes.
Is this vase of great value?
It is a worthless imitation.
Good.
But that desk was...
...priceless.
- Clouseau.
- Oh, yes.
I need your help. Now, it's very
important that you remain calm...
...and you do not turn around.
- Remain calm. Do not turn around.
Behind you in the casino
are the Gas Mask Bandits.
Oh, my God!
The Gas Mask Bandits!
- All Europe is looking for them.
- How can I help?
- Just give me your coat.
- Yes, of course. Why?
I'm not supposed to be here.
But I can't let
the Gas Mask Bandits escape.
- Put it on.
- Yes. Yes, of course. But why?
I'm not supposed to be here,
remember?
Inspector.
My God, man, that was fantastic.
Inspector, was Clouseau's plan to set
a trap for the Gas Mask Bandits?
Does Clouseau think the Bandits
are connected to the Pink Panther?
Is Clouseau
going to be promoted, sir?
I cannot comment
on ongoing investigations.
Drive.
Inspector?
Clouseau?
Good one.
Thank you.
Now, what do you have for me?
We have rounded up
all the people in Paris...
...with the name "You."
- Finally, we are getting somewhere.
Read that back.
You may go.
You speak Chinese?
What, you don't think
I speak Chinese?
If I don't speak Chinese,
what are we doing here?
That must be funny
around the water cooler.
"Oh, Inspector Clouseau
does not speak Chinese.
Let's take him out for lunch.
We will all speak Chinese.
He won't know
what we are talking about."
Is that what you like to do?
Is that funny?
Of course I speak Chinese.
Clouseau?
Bonjour, Nicole.
Could I see you in my office
in a few minutes?
I'll be right with you, inspector.
Yes, inspector?
Nicole.
The weather has been so pleasant.
I was wondering if you think
it's going to stay this mild.
I certainly hope so.
But do you think the weather...
...is going to change?
Let's keep our fingers crossed...
...that it stays this mild.
And here's another one for you!
Now let's see who you are.
It is "Inspector Dreyfus."
The intruder is obviously wearing
a flesh mask.
But that will come off.
My face!
Maybe there is a seam
under your hairline.
I'll just turn you around.
Are you feeling any better?
I am so sorry, inspector.
Let's just forget it.
I thought I would stop by and let you
know how we are doing on the case.
Oh, I'll just...
...stay back here.
- Yes, of course.
I see you have one
of these collapsible pointers.
So very useful.
It is so degrading to have to point
with your finger...
...or one of those
long wooden sticks...
...like you are some sort
of primitive oaf.
But you have one of these, you just
snap it open and you are ready to go.
The case. The case, Clouseau.
Yes, the case.
The case is going quite well.
I have prepared a list of suspects.
And how many suspects
do you have?
Twenty-seven thousand
six hundred eighty-three.
It's just a matter of time now,
isn't it?
- Have you eliminated any suspects?
- Yes.
One.
One. And who would that be?
Gluant.
Gluant is the victim.
Excellent, inspector.
We think alike.
One clue leading inexorably
to the next.
Just leave it.
I assure you, inspector...
...I will soon have your criminal
cornered like a...
Like a... Like... Like a... Like...
Like something...
Something that you... You corner.
- Well put.
- I see you enjoy wordplay.
We will have to have lunch
one day...
...and engage
in a little verbal jousting.
I'm sure you're quite the raconteur.
Yes.
So I will call you for lunch.
There's only one item
on the agenda of this committee:
To approve the list of nominees
for our nation's highest award...
...the Medal of Honor.
The two nominees are...
...Charles Dreyfus...
No.
...and Sister Marie-Hugette...
...whose selfless concern
for our nation's orphans...
...is an inspiration to us all.
I would like to add one more name
for the committee's consideration.
Inspector Jacques Clouseau, the man
who came here from a small village...
...to investigate the murder
of Yves Gluant...
...who just last night captured
the notorious Gas Mask Bandits.
Yes. Interesting idea.
- An average Frenchman.
- Exactly.
Excellent idea.
All in favor?
How is it I was not informed
of Clouseau's going to that casino?
- It was the middle of the night.
- Oh, it was the middle of the night.
What, you did not want to wake me?
I want to know
of Clouseau's whereabouts...
...every hour, 24 hours a day.
You miss one call, and I will have
you kicked off the force.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Why are you not with him now?
- I'm here.
- Get out.
- Clouseau.
- Ponton.
Let's call it a day. I am tired.
I just wanted to see where you are
with the investigation.
Good idea, Ponton.
To let the subconscious mind...
...work on the case while we sleep.
Now then, what are the facts?
Yves Gluant was found...
...at the international championship
semifinal...
...with a poison dart in his neck.
- The crime!
Bizu wanted to kill him,
but is now himself dead.
A complication!
Gluant was siphoning off money...
...from Larocque.
- A motive!
And close to the body
was the singer, Xania.
Xania is not the killer.
But I suspect she knows more
than she is telling me.
- Where is she now?
- She left suddenly for New York.
We are going to have to follow her
and find out what she is up to.
And if I am going to America...
...I am going to have to speak
with a flawless American accent...
...so as not to arouse suspicion.
So find me the greatest
accent coach in the world.
I would like to buy a hamburger.
I would like to buy a hamburger.
I would like to buy a hamburger.
I would like to buy...
...a hamburger.
No, no, no. Let's break it down.
I.
- I.
- I.
- Would.
- Would.

Hamburger.
Hamburger.
Hamburger.
- Hamburger.
- Hamburger.
I would like to buy a hamburger.
I would like to buy a damburger.
It's not "damburger." Hamburger.
I'm not saying "damburger." I said,
"I would like to buy a damburger."
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy the hamburger.
- Hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!
- Maybe we should stop.
- We don't quit.
We do not quit. Again! Again!
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger!
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy a hamburger.
- I would like to buy hamburger!
I would like to buy a hamburger.
- Have you ever had a hamburger?
- Well, of course not.
It's a disgusting American food.
I never see you with women.
I'm married.
You don't wear a ring.
To protect her.
I'm afraid some villain
might threaten her.
Yes.
Tell me about her.
I consider her the most
beautiful woman in the world.
What about yourself?
No, I don't consider myself
a beautiful woman.
I mean, is there a woman
in your life?
Oh, no.
Love has not yet come my way.
How could Inspector Clouseau
be with a simple woman?
She would have to be
so extraordinary in order to keep up.
It's hard.
- What is?
- For you to meet someone.
Oh, yes.
We have a big day tomorrow.
We will go to Xania's hotel
and find out what she is up to.
- Good night, Ponton.
- Good night, Clouseau.
- Good one.
- Thank you.
I got her hotel phone records.
Xania made two phone calls...
...to a notorious
black-market diamond cutter.
There she is! Newspapers!
Newspapers!
Newspapers!
Newspapers!
Floor 12.
I smell something fishy.
May I help you?
Good teamwork.
Stop! Stop whatever it is
you are doing! You are defenseless!
We have already taken care
of your thugs patrolling the building.
I don't have any thugs.
You don't?
Ponton, I think we owe
those men an apology.
And what is it you are cutting?
Pink diamond. Clear.
- Clear?
- It's not the Pink Panther.
And what are you doing here
sneaking around?
This purse once belonged
to Josephine Baker.
It was falling apart, so
I had it studded with diamonds...
...to wear on-stage
at the Presidential Ball.
Well, why did you just not tell me
why you were coming?
I can't be seen at a diamond cutter.
Not after what happened.
That may be one
of your mysterious clients now.
Hello?
Yes, I am the person
in charge of the phone bill.
Well, I'm somewhat happy
with my service.
Twelve months
with that many minutes?
Plus free minutes per month?
Yes, sign me up.
Yes, Jacques Clouseau...
...credit card number:
Yes? Yes, you may have
my e-mail address.
DoctorKnockers@aol.com.
Well, I think I just got myself
a pretty good deal.
- When are you leaving the city?
- I'm leaving tomorrow. Yeah.
I may have to seduce her, Ponton,
in order to get her to talk.
- Part of the job.
- Talk about what?
I want to find out what time
her plane is leaving in the morning.
- Why not just ask her?
- Too obvious.
I may have to pump her
for information.
- I see.
- Inspector...
...would you like to join me
for dinner at the Waldorf?
Certainly, mademoiselle.
Say, 8:00?
Eight o'clock.
Say, I don't know,
my room on the second floor?
"I don't know,
my room on the second floor."
I'll see you then.
It might be a trap.
Who cares?
Welcome to my room, inspector.
It is lovely weather we are having.
Oh, yes, baby. Oh, yes.
Why?
Why what?
Why were you being
so elusive today?
I was afraid of Larocque.
- He might be following me.
- Larocque? The casino owner?
He sent out word
threatening to kill anyone...
...in possession
of the Pink Panther.
He believes it belongs to him.
But why would he follow you?
I was in New York
to see a diamond cutter.
He might draw
the wrong conclusion.
You know...
...a man sitting here
in your private suite...
...so close to you...
...might draw
the wrong conclusion too.
Or the right one.
I've heard things
about you, inspector.
What sort of things?
That you really know
how to treat a woman.
Yes. Yes.
Let the games begin.
Let me just slip away.
Yes!
No! No, no! No, no!
My miracle pill
for the middle-aged man.
Give it back.
Inspector?
- Are you all right in there?
- I hope you're getting yourself ready.
Inspector? Are you sure
you're okay in there?
Yes, I am. I'm fine.
I'm just getting in the mood for love.
Well, hello.
We need fresh towels in 204.
Don't ask why, just do it.
You have the flight number.
He leaves tomorrow out of JFK.
He'll be easy to spot. He's got
white hair, a thin mustache...
...brimming with self-confidence
and completely lost.
- Did you get the stuff?
- Yes.
Good.
Give it to me.
Airline food is for suckers.
I will smuggle this on.
Just act cool.
- Hey, that's Xania!
- Hello.
Hi. Yes, thank you.
I still think she is hiding
something, Ponton.
What?
If I knew what she was hiding,
then it wouldn't be hidden, would it?
- All right. Thank you.
- One more! One more!
Okay, let's go. Next.
Nothing to declare.
- Come on through.
- Hand check on two.
- This your bag, sir?
- Yes, it is.
- We'll have to hand check it.
- Go ahead. I have nothing to hide.
In my bag.
Come with me, sir.
Wait here, pal.
It's a harmless pocketknife.
It's a harmless pair of...
Numchucks?
I don't... I don't even own a mace.
I don't know where that came from.
I've never seen that stuff in my life.
Jimbo!
You don't need Jimbo.
- Jimbo, stay.
- What's in your pocket, sir?
- Nothing.
- Sir, I'll say again...
...what's in your pocket?
- Nothing.
I'm gonna ask you again,
what's in your pocket, sir?
All right.
I have, in my pocket...
...a couple of "hambwortsforts."
What?
I have in my pocket...
...a couple of "dolvargars."
Sir?
- Sir, in your pocket you have...?
- All right, I have four "hanholders."
I'm sorry. Once more.
Again!
- Sir...
- Hey, what's that?
- Sir... Sir, I'm losing my patience.
- Oh, you are?
- You are losing your patience?
- Yes.
I'm simply telling you I have
a couple of "tamburthers."
I've got an End darter down on six.
I've got an End darter down on six!
- Locked and loaded, sir!
- Show me your hands, sir!
All right, I'll just show you.
- No, no, no! Stay here, sir.
- Sic him, W!
- Yes, that's him!
- Inspector, what is a "damburgert"?
Inspector, how does it feel
to have let down the nation?
So much for the heroic
Inspector Clouseau.
Well, this is a glorious day
for France.
How so, chief inspector?
Because a stupid idiot
named Clouseau...
...is going to be stripped of his rank
while I take over his case.
You have a second man
named Clouseau?
My God. Leave us alone
for a moment.
You, out. Go, go. Go.
I must have a private word...
...with Inspector Clouseau.
Understand something, Clouseau.
When I made you an inspector,
it was not because I thought...
...you had any value as a detective.
It was because I thought you were the
stupidest policeman in all of France.
A hopeless, deluded idiot.
Then I was not promoted
for my merits?
I only made you inspector
because I needed someone...
...who would quietly get
nowhere until I was ready...
...to take over the case myself.
I was trying to catch a killer.
You were trying...
You were trying to become a hero.
Well, you will be stripped...
...of your rank,
ridiculed by the media...
...and I will be done with you.
And now if you will excuse me,
ex-inspector, I must go and prepare...
...for the arrest which will win me
the Medal of Honor...
...catapult me to the National
Assembly, and after that, who knows?
- Goodbye, Clouseau.
- Shall we lock him up?
Look at him.
He is finished.
Let him go home to obscurity.
You knew?
Ponton...
...things were not
as I supposed they were.
And if I ever made
you look foolish...
...I am sorry.
It was an honor
serving under you, sir.
Good one.
The Internet.
Hello, old friend.
"To download your new
cell-phone ringtone...
...press the button
that says 'download."'
I take the mouse and I click,
but do not drag...
...the button that says "download."
Gentlemen, and lady,
good morning.
Meet Dr. Li How Pang.
He was, of course, in the VIP box
when Gluant was killed.
Coincidentally, Dr. Pang would
send Gluant large sums of money.
Presumably, Gluant was to invest
these sums on Pang's behalf.
But being a compulsive gambler,
Gluant took the money...
...and gambled it all away.
So Pang had the motive.
He had the opportunity.
Pang is in France
for the president's ball tonight.
We will arrest him there
for the murder of Yves Gluant.
Bravo, chief inspector.
I am pleased to announce that
I am personally taking over...
... the Pink Panther investigation
and that an arrest is imminent.
- Thank you.
- Chief inspector...
... the coroner has announced
that Bizu was killed...
... with a perfect shot to the
occipital lobe. Any comments?
The occipital lobe?
It's irrelevant.
The occipital lobe.
That makes me feel good.
Zoom.
Of course.
Ponton, I need you
over here immediately.
We are back on the case.
Nicole, I believe Bizu and Gluant
were killed by the same person.
And that the killer
will strike again tonight.
I want you to meet me
at the presidential palace.
And bring my vinyl bag marked
"presidential palace."
And hurry! Xania is in grave danger.
Ponton, we must get to the
presidential palace immediately!
- Put your seat belt on.
- I don't need a seat belt.
Let's see what this baby can do!
No. Clouseau should not
be on this list.
He is no longer allowed
at state affairs.
He has been disgraced
and humiliated.
But what about all the reporters
who will want to come in?
When the time is right,
let them pour in.
Clouseau.
I'm sorry, but your name
is not on the list.
Not on the list?
Dreyfus must have made sure
you cannot get in.
Ponton.
- Chief inspector.
- What?
- Inspector, here is your bag.
- Good work, Nicole.
Our men have reported a sighting
of Inspector Clouseau.
- What is that?
- Camouflage. Let's go.
Clouseau?
- Nicole.
- Yes?
I know what he's up to. He wants
to try to make the arrest himself.
- One last thing.
- Yes?
If you see Clouseau,
put him in cuffs for trespassing...
...and parade him through the party.
It's evening...
I want all men on alert.
Arrest him outside.
...and you look beautiful
without your glasses.
Thank you, inspector.
Dr. Pang has arrived.
We will take him after the first song.
Yes, yes. Very true.
Good work, Ponton. We're in.
Look!
It's the killer! After him!
- Change outfits.
- Stop! Turn around.
Who are you?
- What are you doing here?
- We are... We are two... We are...
- I'll tell you exactly who we are.
- Yes.
- We are...
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
Where the hell have you been?
- You know these two?
- Of course I know them.
They are Xania's backup dancers.
They go on in the third act...
...with the Komodo dragon
and the snow machine.
Why do you think they are
dressed like that, for fun?
- Prove it.
- We don't have to prove...
Can't you see these dancers
are exhausted?
Go and fetch them some water.
That was fantastic.
- You think so?
- You are...
...an amazing woman.
Inspector, the killer.
Now I am ready to catch a killer.
Stop!
Stop in the name of the law.
Get him!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
Ponton, you follow him that way.
I'll go this way and cut him off.
Stop!
Turn around.
- You're under arre...
- You are under arrest!
Ponton! After him!
Now.
Go, go!
Well, Dr. Pang.
In the name of the statutes...
...and laws of the great nation
of France...
...I arrest you for the murder
of Yves Gluant.
Clouseau! Arrest him.
Which one is he?
That would be him.
In the name of the statutes and laws
of the great nation of France...
...I arrest you for the murder
of Yves Gluant.
Yuri, the trainer who trains.
And who are you?
I am Inspector Jacques Clouseau.
Gluant was nothing!
I drew up the plays.
He takes credit for brilliant
French defense which I gave him...
...and treats me like I'm dead. Fine.
Now he is dead from Chinese poison.
Inspector, what made you
think it was him?
But, Ponton, think back.
You were there.
WHY DO YOU BOTHER ME?
WHY DID YOU BRING ME HERE?
I'M BUS Y.
THE COACH WAS KILLED
WITH CHINESE POISON.
YOU SHOULD LOOK
FOR SOCCER TRAINERS.
THE Y ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A
KNOWLEDGE OF CHINESE HERBS.
She was right, of course.
According to statute 87223, every
trainer of the national soccer team...
...must have a knowledge
of Chinese herbs.
This made it easy for him
to murder Gluant.
- And Bizu?
- Simple.
Bizu had often heard
Yuri's rants against Gluant.
So Bizu blackmailed Yuri
and got himself killed.
Oh, it's you.
A stunning shot to the head...
...burrowing deeply
into the occipital lobe.
But Yuri is a soccer trainer.
That shot was made
by an expert marksman.
Chief inspector, I'm sure
you're familiar...
...with Russian army statute 611.
Well, of course.
All members must be...
...expert marksmen...
- Expert marksmen.
...and understand the location
of the occipital...
- Occipital lobe, of course.
- Yes.
- Very true.
- Yes, Yuri.
Xania is still alive.
But you hated her. And that's
why you are trying to kill her.
You hated her because she
went with Bizu and then Gluant...
...and treated you
like you were nothing.
But you forgot a fundamental truth
about women.
A woman is like a...
Is like a...
...artichoke.
You have to do a bit of work
before you get to her heart.
What about the diamond?
What about the Pink Panther?
Yes, thank you, Inspector Clouseau
for carrying out my orders.
Hand over the diamond, Yuri.
What do I care about
your stinking diamond?
He does not have the diamond.
The murderer does not have
the diamond?
- No.
- Well, then, where is it...
...lnspector Clouseau?
It is there! In her purse.
Let me see.
Sorry, Clouseau, no diamond.
The purse, please.
Could you hold that, please?
After Gluant came to me, he said
he decided to stop cheating on me.
Then he asked me to marry him...
... and put the ring in my hands.
After he was killed, I thought...
...if I came forward with the ring,
everyone would think I did it.
If Gluant gave you the ring
before he died...
...then according to civil statute
You may keep the Pink Panther.
But, inspector,
how did you know she had it?
It was simple, Ponton.
I was looking at a photo of myself
at the checkpoint.
Something caught my eye:
Xania's purse passing through
the x-ray machine.
I enlarged the photo...
... and in it...
... the Pink Panther.
- The case is closed!
- Bravo, Clouseau.
Bravo!
Clouseau! Clouseau!
Clouseau! Clouseau!
I can't thank you enough
for giving me...
I can't thank you enough
for giving me...
...the opportunity to solve
the Pink Panther murder.
Without your decision to put me
on the case...
...who knows, someone else might've
won the Medal of Honor this year.
Yes, I know.
I owe it all to you, chief inspector.
Without you, I would be nothing.
- Perhaps you still are.
- Excellent verbal joust, inspector.
You idiot! Oh, no.
- Hit it, Ponton.
- No! Clouseau!
Stop the car. Dear...
What?
Nothing.
You didn't say:
"Stop the car. Dear God,
I beg of you, stop the car"?
No.
Does it hurt?
What?
I can't understand you.
You know what,
I think he wants to recline.
There's a lever right here.
Oh, it's on the other side, I'm sorry.
A bit of a reach.
Wait a minute. I'll get it.
I'll get it right here.
Is right back here.
There must be a simpler way...
...of working this...
Oh, there's a remote control...
...so that you can just...
It's sensitive! I hardly touched it!
But it goes up...
That's it! That's it!
- You know, Ponton.
- Yes, inspector.
This is a very hard time
for Inspector Dreyfus.
It is important that
we show compassion.
And we must use the gentle
healing power of laughter.
This is going to hurt.
Clouseau!
That breeze feels good.

I'm kinda lonesome back here.
- Little help...
- Just... I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
Excuse me!
- Dopinder.
- Pool. Dead.
- Nice!
- Smells good, no?
Not the daffodil daydream. The girl.
Yes. Gita. She is quite lovely.
She would have made me
a very agreeable wife. But...
Gita's heart has been
stolen by my cousin, Bandu.
He is as dishonorable
as he is attractive.
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's
a reason I'm in this cab today.
- Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
- No, my slender, brown friend. Love...
... is a beautiful thing. When you find it,
the whole world tastes like daffodil daydream.
So you gotta hold on to love. Tight!
And never let go. Don't make the
same mistakes I did, got it?
Or else the whole world tastes
like Mama June after hot yoga.
Sir, what does Ms Mama June taste like?
Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is it's bad.
Why the fancy red suit, Mr. Pool?
Oh, that's because it's Christmas day, Dopinder,
and I'm after someone on my naughty list.
I've been waiting, 1 year, 3 weeks, 6 days and---
14 minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
- And what did he do to you, Mr. Pool?
- This shit.
Boo!
- They won't disappoint.
- They'd better not!
- What about next month's shipment?
- There won't be one.
You're not the only
one with a war to win.
That won't do.
See, we've had this small
disruption to our supply trade.
We'd appreciate your patience.
Okay...
We'll deliver in full
the following month.
Pleasure doing business with you.
Fucking mutant!
Shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
- Shall we turn back?
- No time. Fuck it. I got this.
9, 10, 11, 12 bullets.
Or bust. Right here!
That's $27.50.
I never carry a wallet while I'm
working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
- But how 'bout a crisp high-five?
- Okay.
Merry Christmas!
And a convivial Tuesday
and April to you, Pool!
Oh! Oh, hello!
I know, right? Whose balls did I
have to fondle to get my very own movie?
I can't tell you, but it does rhyme
with "Pulverine". And lemme tell you...
He's got a nice pair of
smooth criminals down under!
Anyway. I got places to be.
A face to fix. And, oh!
Bad guys to kill.
Maximum effort.
Cock shot!
Rich! Corinthian leather!
I'm looking for Francis!
Have you seen this man?
Yanking, yanking!
I've never said this, but don't swallow.
Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
Now, breaking news.
A multi-car collision turned shots fired
on the crosstown expressway this morning.
Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Residents are advised to remain in their homes.
The assailant appears to be
armed, dangerous, and wearing a...
Red suit. Deadpool.
Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
Colossus, wait up.
I've given Deadpool
every chance to join us.
But he'd rather act like
a child. A heavily armed child.
When will he grow up and see
benefits of becoming X-Man?
Which benefits, the matching unitards?
The house that blows up every few years?
Please. House blowing up builds character.
You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast
is most important meal of day.
Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
Deadpool may try to break yours.
Hey!
Wait! You may be wondering
why the red suit.
Well that's so bad guys
can't see me bleed.
This guy's got the right idea.
He wore the brown pants.
Fine! I only have 12 bullets, so
you're gonna have to share!
Let's count 'em down!
Shit, motherfucker!
Ten! Shit.
Nine! Fuck.
Eight. Shit-fuck!
Bad Deadpool.
Seven. Good Deadpool!
Someone's not counting.
Six!
Four...
Gotcha!
Right up main street!
Three, two! Stupid!
Worth it.
I'm touching myself tonight.
Francis! Francis!
What the shitbiscuit!
Where you at, Francis?
You're not Francis!
Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
You're probably thinking, "my boyfriend said this was a
superhero movie but that guy in the red suit just turned
that other guy into a fucking kebab!"
Well, I may be super. But I'm no hero.
Anyhow, technically, this is a murder. But some
of the best love stories start with a murder.
And that's exactly what this is:
a love story. And to tell it right,
I gotta take you back to long before
I squeeze this ass into red spandex.
Look, would it help if I slow it down
for you? I didn't order the pizza.
Is this 7348 Redledge Drive?
- Are you Mr. Merchant?
- The Mr. Merchant who didn't order the fucking pie!
- Who placed the call?
- I did!
Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty!
The fuck are you? The fuck
are you doing in my crib?
- Is that bread crust? Don't move!
- God, I hope not.
Look, is this about that
poker game? I told Howie...
- Just take whatever you want.
- Thanks!
Sir, before you do anything to him,
do you mind if I get a big tip?
- Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson.
- Yeah.
That is a no go on the tip-aroo, Jer.
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for you.
- I dodged a big-time bullet on that one!
- Not, out of the woods yet.
You need to seriously ease up on the
bedazzling. They're jeans, not a chandelier.
P.S. I'm keeping your wallet.
You did kind of give it to me.
- Just look, man, can I have my---
- I will shoot your fucking cat.
I don't really know what that
means, I don't have a cat.
Then whose kitty litter did I just shit in?
Anywho...
Tell me something. What situation
isn't improved by pizza?
Do you happen to know a Megan
Orflosky? Get that right? Orflovsky?
'Cause she knows you. Jeremy...
I belong to a group of guys who
take a dime to beat a fella down.
And little Megan, she's not made of
money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.
- I'm.....
- A stalker.
Threats hurt, Jer. Though not
nearly as badly as serrated steel.
- So keep away from Megan. Cool?
- Yes, sir.
- And we're done.
- Wait, we are?
Totally done. You should've seen your face!
- I didn't know what to do, I was so scared...
- Soft spot, remember?
Even look in her general direction again and you will learn
in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots, too.
That came out wrong.
Or did it?
Megan.
You've heard the last
of Jeremy. He's sorry.
No friggin' way.
Should've brought my roller blades.
Show these kids how it's done.
And that's why we do it.
But mostly the money.
Hey. Think you can
fuck up my step dad?
If I can give the guy a pavement
facial, it's 'cause he's earned it.
Hey, wait.
- You're my hero.
- No, no, no, no, no. That, I ain't.
Nope. Never will be.
- Fuck you, Wade.
I'm just a bad guy who gets
paid to fuck up worse guys.
Welcome to Sister Margaret's.
It's like a job fair for mercenaries.
Think of us as really fucked up tooth fairies
except we knock out the teeth and take the cash.
You'd best hope we never
see your name on a gold card.
(Buck! Liefeld.)
- Hey, Wade!
- Wade Wilson. Patron Saint of the Pitiful.
- What can I do for you?
- I'd love a blowjob.
- Oh, God, me too.
- The drink. With snuggle. But first...
- Hey, I ain't taking any babysitting money,
make sure that gets back to Miss...
- Orlovsky?
- You sure?
- Hmm.
For a merc, you're pretty warm-blooded.
Bet you let the kid off easy, too.
He's not a bad kid. Just a little light stalking. I was way
worse when I was his age, travelling to exotic places...
Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville,
meeting new and exciting people. And then..
Killing them. Yeah, I've seen your instagram.
So what were special forces doing in Jacksonville?
That's classified. They
have wonderful TGIFridays!
Alright, kahlua, baileys
and whipped cream.
I give you, a blowjob. I'm---
- Why do you make me make that?
- Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...
Take that over there to Buck, please and
tell him it's from Booth. Little foreplay.
- Remind me what good will come of this?
- I don't take the shits, I just disturb them.
What you want?
- Cheers. To your health.
- Fuck you.
That's a new stool.
Stay the fuck down.
Alright, move, move, move, move.
Buck, go rest.
He's still breathing.
Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.
You got me. I picked Booth in
the dead pool. Who did you pick?
- You know, Wade, about that....
- No. You did not bet on me to die.
You bet on me to die. Wow. Motherfucker,
you're the world's worst friend.
Well, joke's on you. I'm living to 102.
And then die. At the city of Detroit.
Sorry. I wanted to win money.
I never win anything.
- Whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drink's on me!
- Yeah!
Domestic! Nothing imported.
Woah, woah, woah. Baby...
Are you sure you wanna
shoot your whole wad?
Tight.
- Vanessa.
- Wade.
What's a nice place like
you doing in a girl like this?
I'd hit that.
Buck, you'd best apologize
before--- yeah. That.
- Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
- I'm sorry.
- Breathe through the nose.
- I don't have a filter between my brain and my...
Okay, hey. Hakuna
his tatas, he's sorry!
- Get outta here. Go cast a spell.
- Hey, hands off the merchandise.
Merchandise, huh. So you...
- Fun fuzzies for money?
- Yup.
- Rough childhood?
- Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
Daddy left before I was conceived.
- Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
- Where else do you put one out?
- I was molested.
- Me, too. Uncle.
- Uncles. They took turns.
- I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole
of a locked closet which also happens to be my...
Your bedroom. Lucky. I
slept in a dishwasher box.
You had a dishwasher. I didn't even know sleep. It was
pretty much 24/7 ball kegs, brownie mix and clown porn.
Who would do such a thing?
Hopefully, you. Later tonight?
What can I get for 275 dollars
and a yogurt rewards card?
Baby, about 48 minutes of
whatever the fuck you want.
And a low-fat dessert.
Did she just put a gift
card in your mouth?
It's time to put
balls in holes.
- You said whatever I want.
- I get it.
- You love ski ball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
- That's a tough call.
I just wanna get to know the real you. Not the short-
shorted 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
Balls in holes.
- Prepare to lose tragically.
- Bring it, big man.
A limited edition Voltron: Defender
of the Universe ring, por favor.
Okay. Here you go.
I had this sucker for a while.
- And I will take the pencil eraser.
- Okay.
You are now the proud protector of the planet Arus.
And you, can erase stuff. Written in pencil.
- Milady.
- I hate to break it to you,
but your 48 minutes are up.
How many more minutes
could I get for this?
FYI, 5 mini lion bots come
together to form 1 superbot.
- 5 mini lion bots? 3 minutes.
- Deal. What do we do with the remaining 2:37?
Cuddle?
- How long can we keep this up?
- All year?
Happy Valentines' Day.
- Happy Chinese New Year.
- Year of the Dog.
Relax... and happy
International Women's Day.
Happy Lenten.
- Wade!
- Sorry. Happy Halloween!
Happy Thanksgiving.
I love you.
If your left leg is Thanksgiving,
and your right leg is Christmas...
Can I visit you
between the holidays?
That sweater is terrible!
But red looks good on you.
Red's your color. Mine's like
the bloodshot in your eyes.
- Listen. I've been thinking.
- Really?
- 'Bout why we're so good together.
- Why is that?
Your crazy matches
my crazy. Bigtime.
And we're like 2 jigsaw
pieces. Weird curvy edges?
- You put them together and you
can see the picture on top.
- Right.
Wade... There's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
But only because you haven't
gotten around to asking me.
Will you...
- Stick it up my---
- ...Marry me?
Uh... Jinx?
- Where were you hiding that?
- Nowhere.
- They said 1-month salary, so ...
- You mean...
- I do.
- That's my line.
- I love you, Wade Wilson.
- You're supposed to... So that's a...
- Yes!
- Woo! Yes!
I feel just like a little girl!
- What if I just held on and never let go?
- Just ride the bitch's back like Yoda on Luke.
- Star Wars jokes!
- Empire!
Jesus Christ, it's like I
made you in a computer!
Perfect.
Pee break. Shake it, yeah.
Here's the thing:
Life is an endless series of train wrecks with
only brief commercial-like breaks of happiness.
This had been the
ultimate commercial break.
Which meant it was time to return,
to our regularly scheduled programme.
- What the fu.....
- Oh my God, Wade!
You're clowning. You're
not clowning. I sense clowns.
People react to news of late-
stage cancer differently.
There are certainly options we can look into.
New drugs are being developed every day.
So what do we do? Surely,
there is something we can do.
My Uncle Ivan was diagnosed with Thyroid cancer and
there were all these experimental drugs from Germany...
Vanessa's already working on plan
A, B, all the way through Z.
Me? I'm memorizing the details of her
face. Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
- Or the last...
- Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson?
Take your time to process this. It's
important not to do anything rash.
Now, if I were a 200 pound sack of assholes
named Francis, where would I hide?
"A hush falls over the crowd as rookie sensation Wade W.
Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan, lines up the shot."
"His form looks good."
"And that's why Regina
rhymes with fun."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what you're
witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge!"
"Giving him the business! Incoming!"
"This is taking unsportsman-like
conduct to a whole new level!"
Looking good, Francis. Well-rested.
Like you've been pitching, not catching.
Ringing any bells? No?
How 'bout now?
Wade fucking Wilson.
- Well, hello, gorgeous.
- Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Shar Pei.
And whose fault is that, huh, Francis? Time
to undo what you did to this butter face.
You should thank me. Apparently, I've made
you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.
Yeah, but this ain't a
life worth living, is it? Now...
I'm about to do to you what Limp
Bizkit did to music in the late 90's.
Dad?
I think we can all agree that shit just went
sideways in the most colossal way.
Well, maybe not the most.
Now this, is my most prized possession.
- Wham?
- No, no, no, no. WHAM!
Make It Big is the album that George and
Andy earned the exclamation point.
So, am I supposed to just
smile and wave you out the door?
Think of it like spring cleaning.
Only if spring was death.
God, if I had a nickel for everytime I
spanked at the Bernadette Peters.
Sounds like you have. Bernadette is not going
anywhere, because you're not going anywhere.
- Drink.
- You're right.
Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate
and brain. All things I can live without.
You belong here at home. Surrounded by
your Voltron, and your Bernadette and your me.
Listen, we both know
that cancer is a shit show.
Not a good one, like Slapchop,
more Shakeweighty.
The world needs extraordinary soldiers.
We won't just make you better.
We will make you better than better.
- A superhero.
- Look, Agent Smith, I tried the
hero business and it left a mark.
But if I ever hit fuck
-it, I'll look you up.
Oh. Shit.
We're within 500 yards of the school.
So you may wanna, you know...
His drink's on him.
What'd he say?
Hey, what's going on?
Hey, sorry. I had a
Liam Neeson nightmare.
I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter
and he just wasn't having it.
They made 3 of those movies.
At some point, you'd have to
wonder if he's just a bad parent.
The worst part about cancer
isn't what it does to you.
But what it does to
the people you love.
Who knew if this guy could save my life? But I
knew there's only one way that I could save hers.
Isn't that what superheroes do?
Okay. Let's pro/con
this superhero thing.
Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass, local dry
cleaning discounts, lucrative film deals,
both origin stories and larger,
ensemble team movies.
Con: they're all lame-ass teacher's pets!
- You know I can hear you.
- Wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them.
Stay right here. You've been
warned before, Deadpool.
This is a shameful and reckless use of your
powers. You will both be coming with us.
Look Colossus, I don't have time for the goody
two-shoes bullshit right now. And you are?
Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
Negasonic Teenage---
What the shit?!
That's the coolest name ever!
- So what, you're like his sidekick?
- No. Trainee.
- Let me guess, X-Men left you behind
on what, shit detail?
- What does that make you?
Pretending you're not here, Negasonic
Teenage Warhead. Can we trade names?
- Can we go?
- "Look! I'm a teenage girl!"
"I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen
silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences."
So what's it gonna be? Long, sullen
silence? Or mean comment? Go on.
- You got me in a box here.
- We can't allow this, Deadpool. Please, come quietly.
- You big, chrome cockgobbler!
- That's not nice.
You really got to fuck
this up for me? Trust me...
That wheezing bag of dick-tits
has it coming! He's pure evil!
Besides, nobody's getting hurt.
That guy was already
up there when I got here.
- Wade, you are better than this. Join us,
use your powers for good.
- Heads up!
- Be a superhero.
- Listen! The day I decide to be a crime-fighting shit-swizzler,
who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland
Mansion of some creepy, old, bald, heaven's gate looking motherfucker,
on that day, I'll send your shiny, happy ass a friend
request. But until then, I'mma do what I came here to do.
- Either that, or slap the bitch out of you!
- Wade...
- Hey. Hey, Douchepool!
- Zip it, Sinead!
And I hope you're watching...
Quite unfortunate.
That does it!
Canada!
- That's not good. Cock shot!
- Wade, please.
Oh, your poor wife!
You really should stop.
All the dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.
- I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
- This is embarassing.
Please. Stay down.
Did you ever hear of the one-legged
man in the ass-kicking contest?
- Do you have 'off' switch?
- Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the 'on' switch?
Enough!
Let us go talk to the Professor.
McAvoy or Stewart? These
timelines are so confusing...
- Dead or alive, you're coming with me!
- You will recover, Wade. You always do.
Did you ever see "127 Hours"?
Spoiler alert!
Oh my God. Nasty.
Oh, there's the money shot, baby. Are
you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
Rock, meet bottom.
When life ends up breathtakingly fucked, you can
generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.
The one that sent you
down the road to Shitsburg.
This, well, this was mine.
Mr. Wilson. Nothing warms my heart
more than a change of someone else's.
You've finally hit fuck-it.
- Just promise you'll do right by me.
So I can do right by someone else.
- Of course.
And please don't make the
super-suit green. Or animated!
This place seems sanitary.
My first request is warmer hands.
And Jesus! A warmer table.
You should really come up with a safe
word, fellas. I'm thinking 'pork and beans'.
Easy!
Aren't you a little strong for a lady?
I'm calling Wang.
What's up with the matches?
Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
- Patience, Angel. All in good time.
- Are you here for the turn down service or what?
- We have another talker.
- I'm just excited about my first day at superhero camp.
Shut the fuck up.
Mr. Wilson, my name's
Ajax. I manage this workshop.
All of my welcome speeches used
to be filled with euphemisms like,
"this may hurt a little," or
"this might cause you some discomfort."
But I'm going blunt. This workshop
is not a government-led program.
It's a private institution that turns reclamation
projects like yourself into men of....
Extraordinary abilities.
But if you think superhuman powers
are acquired painlessly... Wrong.
I'm injecting you with a serum that activates
any mutant genes lurking in your DNA.
For it to work, we need to
subject you to extreme stress.
You've heard the whole, "make an
omelet, break some eggs" bit, I hope.
I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was
a patient here once myself, you know.
The treatment affects everyone differently.
It made Angel inhumanly strong.
In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, also scorched
my nerve endings so I no longer feel pain.
And in fact, I no
longer feel anything.
Thank-- thank you! You
have something in your teeth.
Right in the middle there, just...
Nugget of romaine lettuce or something.
It's been bothering
me for a long time.
Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name,
because it sounds suspiciously made up.
What is it really? Kevin? Bruce? Scott?
Mitch? Rickster? Is it Basil Faulty?
Joke away. One thing that never survives
this place is your sense of humor.
- We'll see about that.
- I suppose we will.
- He's all yours.
- C'mon. You're gonna leave me all alone
here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst
for the serum, so we're gonna have to make you suffer.
If you're lucky, your mutant genes will
activate and manifest in a spectacular fashion.
If not, well, we'll have
to keep on hurting you.
In new and different ways,
each more painful than the last.
Until you finally mutate...
... or die.
- You mean like a bucket list?
- Like a fuck it list, I'd like to light a
spiff off the Olympic torch.
Acid to me, right after.
Let's not forget: naked tandem base-jumping
with the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs.
Anything on my bucket list
would involve public nudity.
Finally, giving Meredith
Baxter Birney a dutch oven.
No, receiving a dutch oven
from Meredith Baxter Birney.
Making banana
pancakes... For my kids...
Vanessa...
I wanna see Vanessa.
Oh, lovely. I don't know about
anyone else but, I'm touched.
- We're just joking.
- No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions.
Wouldn't want you giving
up on us now, would we?
Hey, don't take any shit from him,
Cunningham. How tough can he be...
- ... with a name like Francis?
- Francis?
It's his legal name. He
got Ajax from a dish soap.
F-R-A-N-C-I--- oops!
Snagged the dry cleaning
tag off your lab coat.
FYI, I can probably get
you a superhero discount.
- You are so relentlessly annoying.
- Thanks. Never heard that before.
Why don't you do us all a favor and shut
the fuck up? Or I'll sew your pretty mouth shut.
Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
See, here's the problem with round-the-clock
torture, it's that you can't really step it up from there.
Is that what you think?
If this doesn't unlock your
mutation, then, well, nothing will.
What we're gonna do is lower the oxygen concentration in
the air to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating.
If your brain wave's slowing and you're about
to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2.
If your heart rate slows meaning you're able
to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down.
And that's where we'll
leave you. Right there.
- I thought you guys were dicks before...
- You know the funniest part of this?
You still think we're
making you a superhero.
You? A dishonorable discharge?
Hip deep in hookers?
You're nothing. A little secret, Wade...
This workshop doesn't make
superheroes, we make superslaves.
We're gonna fit you with a control collar
and auction you off to the highest bidder.
And that's what they'll have you doing. Terrorizing
citizens, putting down freedom fighters.
Maybe just mow
the occasional lawn.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're never going home after
this. Now there's a brave face.
Wait, wait, wait...
Seriously, you actually have
something in your teeth now.
- Enjoy your weekend.
- Weekend? Back up, weekend?
Did I say this was a love
story? No. It's a horror movie.
Fucking hell! Looks like someone
lost a shot at homecoming king.
- What have you done to me?
- I've mainly raised your stress levels
high enough to trigger a mutation.
- You sadistic fuck!
- I've cured you, Wade.
Now your mutated cells can heal anything.
Striking your cancer as fast as it can form.
Yeah, I've seen some other side
effects before... I could cure them.
But where's the fun in that?
Now I'm gonna shut
you in again, Wade.
Not because I need to.
Because I want to.
Farewell. Go ahead.
You already smell like shit.
- Motherfucker...
- That's alright, it's alright...
I think we have earned that one.
You take off. Go on, off you go.
Quick question:
What's my name?
Didn't think so.
Sorry, Francis. My lips are sealed.
You don't wanna kill me. I'm the
only one who can fix your ugly mug!
What's my name?
Wade...
I didn't just get the cure to el cancer...
I got the cure to el everything.
But there was only one
thing that really mattered.
No way. I'm not making
her life as ugly as mine.
- Come on, Wade, it can't be that bad.
- Bullshit! I'm a monster inside now.
- I belong in a fucking circus.
- Wade, Vanessa loves you.
- She doesn't care what you--- Oh!
- Do you like what you see?
No. You look like an avocado had sex
with an older, more disgusting avocado.
Not gently. He was hate-fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship and that was their only catharsis without violence.
And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the British
shitstick who ran the mutant factory. And he's gone--- Poof!
You gotta do something to remedy this. 'Cause
as of now, you only have one course of action:
- Damn straight. Find Francis.
- Star in horror fims.
- What?
- Star in your own horror films.
'Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face-
fucked a topographical map of Utah.
Here's what I'm actually gonna do:
I'm gonna work thru his crew until somebody gives up Francis,
force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brainhole.
I don't wanna see that,
or think of it again. But,
- the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
- Yeah.
- That's good. You should keep it that way.
- What, like, wear a mask?
Yes, a very thick mask. All the
time. I'm sorry, you're haunting.
- Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
- Like a testicle with teeth.
You will die alone. I mean if you
could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
- That'll do.
- What you need now is a suit and a
nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker...
- ... or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie. Oh, shit.
- What?
- I put all my money on you, and now I
just realized I'm never gonna win the....
- Deadpool...
Captain Deadpool.
No. Just-just Deadpool. Yeah.
To you, Mr. Pool. Deadpool. That
sounds like a fuckin' franchise.
This shit's gonna
have nuts in it!
Where's Francis?
Seltzer water and lemon for
blood. Or wear red. Dumbass!
Don't make me ask twice.
Where is Francis?
He made me ask twice.
Is the mask muffling my voice?
You're about to be
killed by a Zamboni!
- No, please...
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Little spider-monkey!
This is confusing! Is it sexist to hit you, is it
more sexist to not hit you, the line gets real blurry!
Donde esta Francesca?
Tell me where your fucking boss is!
Or you're gonna die! In 5 minutes!
Nice to see you, Jared. I'll
take a foot long. Fully loaded.
- 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89, about to be 90.
- Mr. Wilson?
- You're looking very alive.
- Hah! Only on the outside.
- This is not going to end---
- This is not gonna end well for you, no.
- Where's your boss?
- I can tell you exactly where---
You'll tell me. But first, you might wanna look
away for this. Now this little piggy went to...
Thank you, Agent Smith.
Taxi!
Hop in! Great day for a ride.
And we all know
how this turned out.
Whoops! You weren't
meant to see that.
There. All caught up.
Sorry! About bleeding
at all your garbage.
Seltzer water and
lemon for blood.
Some kinds of anger
can't be managed.
Like the kind where your year-long plan
ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered!
That said, when it comes time to licking
wounds, there's no place like home.
Morning, sleepyhead.
- It smells like old lady pants in here.
- Yes I'm old, I wear pants.
But you're no lady.
Oh, so comfy.
- Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
- You mean my big, rubber, masturbating shoes?
Yes I know. Downside of being blind,
I hear everything in this duplex.
- Sit on a stick.
- Bactine?
Bactine should do it.
How's that () coming along? Ikea
doesn't assemble itself, you know.
You're telling me. I don't mind the ().
It's an improvement on the ().
Anything's an improvement over the ().
I'd taken an () or a () over the ().
No, I didn't get
excited 'till I saw ().
- Screw, please.
- Here? Now? Just kidding. I know it's been decades.
- You'd be surprised.
- Pretty grossed out.
Ta------da...
I wish I never heard, of Craigslist.
And I quote, "Looking for roommate, blind, and likes imperfections. Must be good with hands." Or would you rather I build the Ikea and you pay rent?
- Why such a douche this morning?
- Let's recap:
The cock-fizzle that turned me into this
freak slipped through my arms today.
Arm.
Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super
-sexy ex back and prevent this from happening to someone else.
So yeah, today was about as
much fun as a sandpaper dildo.
#drive-by.
Found out who our
friend in the red suit is.
Fucking Wade Wilson. Suppose I'd wear
a mask, too, if I had a face like that.
I only wish I'd heal the same.
Still, we'll put him out of
our misery. On our terms.
- Right. And when he heals?
- He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal.
You know, it's funny. I
almost missed the fucker.
I like a challenge. But he's bad
for business. Now let's go find him.
- Tylenol PM?
- It sticks back where you stuck the Bactine.
I raided my stash of wisdom just to take a sec
and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
But I appreciate the gesture.
Am I crazy? Or is
your hand really small?
About the size of a KFC spork.
I get why you're so pissy, but your mood's never gonna
brighten 'till you find this woman and tell her how you feel.
What do I keep telling you, Mrs. McGoo? She wouldn't
have me. If you could see me, you'd understand.
- Looks aren't everything.
- Looks are everything! Ever heard David Beckham speak?
It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium. You think
Ryan Reynolds got this far on a superior acting method?
- Love is blind, Wade.
- No...
You're blind.
So you're just gonna
lie there and whimper?
No, I'm gonna wait 'till this arm plows through puberty
and then I'll come up with a whole, new Christmas day plan.
In the meantime, you might wanna leave
the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand.
Go, go, go, go, go...
So the doctor says, the bad news is you don't have
that long to live. So the patient says, how long do I have?
The doctor says, five.
The guys says, five what?
The doctor says, 4, 3, 2...
Can I help you ladies?
Oh, I do hope so.
Now, I heard you might be able to point
me in the direction of a, a friend of mine.
Name of Wade Wilson.
Sorry, I don't know the name.
Hey, you're not supposed
to be behind the bar.
- I've seen this girl.
- This must be Vanessa. I've
heard so much about you.
Sweetheart, you might wanna look around. This
isn't really the place to do something like that.
Easy, Angel. Put
the little man down.
- We have everything we need now.
- You sure?
You don't want any clothes
that are not monochromatic?
There's a midnight showing of Blade II.
Thanks for having my back, guys.
Wade, we have a fucking
problem, and by we, I mean you.
I can't believe we're doing this. Is there
a word for half-afraid, half-angry?
"Afrangry", I guess. Have you
decided what you're gonna say to her?
- Fuck me!
- Maybe not start with that.
Hey, coming on to our stage
right now, give it up for Chastity!
- Or as I like to call her, Irony.
- I gotta find her fast, before numb nuts does.
- How do you know she's in here?
- Some customer stalking that fox.
Every time I see her,
it's like the first time.
Especially from this angle.
You can't buy love, but you
can rent it for three minutes.
You weak motherfucker!
C'mon. Get it together, this isn't
about you, this is about Vanessa.
Here we go.
Maximum effort.
Vanessa!
Someone out back asking for you.
Something about... an old boyfriend?
I knew it was you. 'Cause
we're weird curvy edges.
Like a jigsaw puzzle.
You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
- Hey, where did she go?
- I saw her head to the back. Go get her, tiger.
Motherfucker!
- Wade, Wade, Wade, Wade...
- Cunt! Chocolate---
- Jiminy---- Fuck! Fuck!
- We can talk... or you can hit that...
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Relax, relax. Okay...
I'm gonna rip his motherfucking-- find
that, find it, or I'm gonna get angry.
Here, this is Vanessa.
No, wait, it's Francis.
- He wants you to come to him.
- What is that?
That's the shit emoji. It's the turd with the smiling face and
the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
- I need guns.
- Okay, which ones?
- I need all the guns!
- All right, okay.
- That's about 3000 rounds.
- And we all know what I can do with 12.
Hey, hey, careful with that,
Ronnie Milsap, we're downrange.
I was gonna spend the night assembling
the () but this is holding my interest.
- I told you, we're going with the (), not the (),
get it thru your head or get outta Fucktown!
- Shit.
- That's all the pieces in the house.
- No, no, no, come on. Let's go. Cough it up.
- Down, down, down, down.
- Fuck you.
25 cal. I like it.
Wade...
I'd go with you, but...
I don't wanna.
Oh, listen, Al...
If I never see you again, I want you
to know that I love you very much.
And also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere
in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness.
Good luck.
You wanna get fucked up?
Put her down over here.
Go on, then.
- Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
- You're a talker, too. You and Wade.
I've been trying to tell you assholes you
got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.
See, I thought that, too. But he keeps on
coming back. Like a cockroach, but uglier.
Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see
how he fights with your head on the block.
- Ripley! From Alien 3!
- Fuck, you're old.
- Fake laugh! Hiding real pain! Go get Silver balls.
- You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
Like there's something wrong with eating
before sundown or saving money. No.
You know that bad guy that
you let go? He's got my girl.
- You're gonna help me get her back.
- Wade? Is that you?
Yeah, it's me Deadpool, and I got
an offer that you can't refuse!
I'm gonna wait out here,
okay? It's a big house!
It's funny that I only ever see 2 of you. It s almost
like, the studio couldn't afford another X-Man.
And that, is why in my opinion, the
movie Cocoon, is pure pornography.
- Who brought this twinkly man?
- Twinkly, but deadly.
My chrome-penised friend back there, has agreed to do me this
solid. In exchange, I said I would consider joining his boy band.
- It's not boy band.
- Sure, it's not.
- So, any luck winning Gita back?
- I tried to hold on tight, Mr. Pool, but Bandu
is more craftier and handsomer than me.
Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.
- Dopinder?
- Hmm?
- What was that?
- That was........ Bandu, in the trunk?
- Ban-who?
- My romantic rival, Bandu.
He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing as you said, DP, I plan to gut
him like a tandoori fish then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely
not! We got lost in translation!
Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's
heart back! (I'm so proud of you.)
Drop Bandu off safe
and gentle-like. (Kill him.)
And then, win Gita back the old-fashioned
way, with your boyish charm! (Kidnap her.)
He's super dead.
- I presume a crisp high-five?
- For you? Ten!
Okay, guys, let's get out there and make
a difference! (You know what to do.)
Knock 'em dead, pool boy!
Time to make the
chimi-fucking-changas.
Not often a dude ruins your face, skullstomps your sanity, grabs your baby mama and personally sees thru 4 of your 5 shittiest moments.
Let's just say it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.
Hey, where's your duffel bag?
Goddammit! We'll do this the old-
fashioned way. With two swords..
... and maximum effort.
Cue the music.
Wade Wilson!
- What's my name?
- Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for 'ya.
- Go get some.
- Superhero landing. She's gonna
do a superhero landing, wait for it!
Superhero landing! You know, that's really hard
on your knees. Totally impractical, they all do it.
You're a lovely lady but I'm saving myself
for Francis. That's why I brought him.
I'd prefer not to hit a
woman, so please----
I mean, that's why I brought her?
Oh no. Finish your tweet. Just give us
a second. Here you go. Hash tag it.
Go get her, tiger.
I so pity the dude who
pressures her into prom sex.
Alright then. Fire!
Finish fucking her the fuck off!
- Language, please.
- Suck a cock!
Look away, child. Look away!
- Wait! Wait!
- Cease fire! Cease fire!
Fellas, hey, you only work for
that shit-spackled Muppet fart.
So, I'mma give you a chance for y'all to lay down your firearms
in exchange for preferential, bordering on gentle, possibly...
... even lover-like treatment.
Fine! Commando!
Teabag!
- Bob?
- Wade?
- Oh my God, I haven't seen you since, TGIFridays!
- Jacksonville. Fridays.
What the hell! God!
Come here, you.
How are the kids? Good? And Gail, is she still
fixing that tuna casserole? It's so good, but bad for...
- Your... on the left... You are beautiful...
- That is so sweet! Thanks!
Does he write you notes,
too? He's such a romantic.
Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.
Fire!
Hey! Climb on.
Motherfucker shoulda
worn his brown pants.
- You were right, beautiful.
Red really is my color.
- Wade?
Don't worry, baby. I'mma
get you outta that shitbox.
- What better way to crawl back
inside that head of yours.
- Oh, you never left.
- But you did, asshole!
- Deep breath, darling.
No wait.... Wrong
choice of words.
Well I hope they've blocked pain to your
every last nerve. 'Cause I'mma go looking!
I hear you grow back body parts now, Wade.
When I'm finished, what's left to grow back you?
Good one.... Yup.
That was a good one.
Let's dance. And by "dance", I
mean let's try to kill each other.
- Fine. Fists.
- Sounds like your last Saturday night.
Asshole!
- Hang in there, baby. I got you.
- Wade!
I got a plan. You're
not gonna like it.
Shit, shit, shit!
Don't worry! I'm
totally on top of this.
Dammit! Maximum effort!
Thanks.
Just take it slow.
Oh, my God! That was so awe---
- Me and you, are headed
to fix this butter face!
- What?
You sure are a fucking idiot.
Did you really think
there was a cure, for that?
- What?
- You heard me.
No, no!
So, you mean to say...
After all this, you can't fix me?
It sounds even
stupider when you say it.
Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't
do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
Any last words?
- What's my name?
- Who fucking cares!
Wade!
- Four or five moments.
- I'm sorry?
- Four or five moments, that's all it takes.
- To...?
Be a hero.
Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero.
Brush your teeth a hero. Go to work a hero. Not true.
Over a lifetime, there are only 4
or 5 moments that really matter.
Moments when you're offered a choice.
To make a sacrifice, conquer
a flaw, save a friend...
... spare an enemy.
In these moments, everything else falls away.
The way the world sees us.
The way we---
- What the fuck am I gonna tell her?
- Well, you better figure it out.
I can't even tell you... I deserve that...
that too.. No, no, no, maybe not the nethers.
Start talking!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For
everything. I'm sorry for leaving,
- I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner...
It's been a rough couple of years.
- Rough?
I live in a crackhouse.
With a family of 12...
Every night we spoon for warmth, everybody
fights for Noelle. She's the fattest.
There is nothing that we don't share.
Floor space, dental floss, even condoms.
So you live in a house?
I should've come
and found you sooner.
But everything under this mask,
he ain't the same one you remember.
You made this mask?
And this one. In case
the other fell off.
Like a band-aid. Just... Audi 5000.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
- Wow.
- Yeah.
Hey...
After a brief adjustment period,
and a bunch of drinks..
It's a face...
I'd be happy to sit on.
But I'm not the same underneath
this suit either. Super-penis.
Come on, Wade, language.
Young one is present.
What are you still doing ---- Get
outta here, go make yourself useful.
You, go be a really big brother to someone.
Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn.
And you, chicken noodle. Nothing
Compares 2 U. Sinead O'Connor, 1990. Sorry.
- That's all right. You're cool.
- What in the ass?
- That was not mean! I'm proud of you!
- We will make an X-Man of you yet, Wade.
You know, for a second there, it felt like we were 3 mini
lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
- This was stupid.
- Yeah.
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.
Come here.
WHAM! As promised.
See? You don't need to be
a superhero to get the girl.
The right girl will bring
out the hero in you.
Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, here we go...
Looks nice, not gonna be the only thing that's pulling out tonight.
Who doesn't love a happy ending, huh? Until next
time, this is your friendly neighborhood Pool guy singing...
You're still here.
It's over! Go home!
Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2.
Well, we don't have that kind of money.
What were you expecting, Sam Jackson'll
show up? Eye patch? Saucy leather? Go, go.
Oh! But I can tell you one thing
and it's a bit of a secret.
In the sequel, we're gonna have Cable. Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time-travel. We have no idea who to cast yet,
but it could be anybody. Just
take a big guy with a flat top.
Could be Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley.
She's got range, who knows? Anyway, big secret.
And don't leave your garbage rotting
around. It's a total dick move. Go.

Where's my suitcase?
Miss. Young lady!
Excuse me. Girls!
Hey, little fella. Hey!
Excuse me, girls. Girls!
Hey, big fella!
Help me make the beds
in the living room.
Come on down here!
Hey, son!
Big fella.
Hey, little guy! Little guy!
Pete's brother
and his family are here.
Trish is going to Montreal.
Montreal? Oh, her family's there.
- Then we're off.
- When?
- Tomorrow.
- You're not ready, are you?
Uncle Frank won't let me
watch the movie...
...but the big kids can.
Why can't I?
I'm on the phone.
When do you come back?
Not till then?
It's not even rated R.
He's just being a jerk.
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...
...then it must be really bad.
No, we put the dog in the kennel...
Hey, get off!
Kevin, out of the room.
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't you?
This kid.
Did you pick up
a voltage adaptor thing?
No, I didn't have time.
- Then how do I shave in France?
- Grow a goatee.
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.
I've got something, pick up those
MicroMachines that are all over.
Aunt Leslie almost broke her neck.
He was playing
with the glue gun again.
We talked about that.
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.
I made ornaments out of fish hooks.
- My new fish hooks?
- I can't make them out of old ones...
...with dry worm guts stuck on them.
- Peter.
- Come on, Kevin. Out.
Do you guys have a voltage adaptor?
Here's a voltage adapter!
God, you're getting heavy!
Go pack your suitcase.
Pack my suitcase?
- Where's the shampoo?
- I don't live here.
This many people here and no shampoo.
- Are your folks home?
- They don't live here.
- Tracy, did you order the pizza?
- Buzz did.
Excuse me. Are your parents here?
My parents live in Paris.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.
- Do they live here?
- No.
Why should they?
All kids, no parents.
Probably a fancy orphanage.
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done it once.
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.
What did I say?
You told him "Tough."
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What was I supposed to say?
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?
- I'm not an idiot!
- Really?
You're helpless! We have to do
everything for you.
- She's right, Kev.
- Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm small.
I don't know how to pack.
- I hope you didn't just pack crap.
- Shut up, Linnie.
You know what I should pack?
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.
What are you so worried about?
You know Mom's gonna
pack your stuff, anyway.
You're what the French call
les incompetents.
What?
Bombs away!
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.
This house is so full of people
it makes me sick!
When I grow up and get married,
I'm living alone!
Did you hear me?
I'm living alone!
I'm living alone!
Who's gonna feed your spider?
He just ate a load of mice guts.
He'll be good for a couple weeks.
Is it true French babes
don't shave their pits?
Some don't.
But they got nude beaches.
Not in the winter.
Don't you know how to knock,
phlegm-wad?
Can I sleep here?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
If he drinks, he'll wet the bed.
I wouldn't let you sleep in my room
if you were growing on my ass.
Check it out.
Old man Marley.
Who's he?
You ever heard of the South Bend
Shovel Slayer?
That's him.
In '58 he murdered his whole family
and half the people on his block...
...with a snow shovel.
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.
If he's the shovel slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?
Not enough evidence to convict.
They never found the bodies.
Everyone around here knows he did it.
It'll just be a matter of time...
...before he does it again.
What's he doing?
He walks up and down the streets
every night...
...salting the sidewalks.
Maybe he's just trying to be nice.
No way.
See that garbage can full of salt?
That's where he keeps his victims.
The salt turns the bodies
into mummies.
Mummies!
Look out!
How you kids doing?
Good?
Lot of action around here today, huh?
Going on vacation?
Where you going?
You hear me, or what?
Going on a trip?
Where you going, kid?
Okay, that's $122.50.
Not from me, kid. I don't live here.
You just around for the holidays?
You could say that.
- Pizza's here!
- There you go.
That's $122.50.
It's my brother's house.
He'll get it.
Hey, listen...
- Are you Mr. McCallister?
- Yeah.
The Mr. McCallister who lives here?
Good, because somebody owes me $122.50.
I'd like a word with you.
Am I under arrest or something?
There's always a lot of burglaries
around the holidays.
We're checking the neighborhood to see
if the proper precautions are taken.
We have automatic timers for our
lights, locks for our doors.
That's about as well
as anybody can do.
- Did you get some eggnog?
- Come on.
- Let's eat.
- Come on.
- Eggnog?
- Pizza!
- Are you gonna be leaving...?
- Pizza!
Grab a napkin
and pour your own drinks.
- Does Santa go through customs?
- What time do we have to go to bed?
Early. We're leaving at 8 a.m.
On the button.
I hope you're all drinking milk.
I want to get rid of it.
- Pizza boy needs $122.50, plus tip.
- For pizza?
Ten pizzas times 12 bucks.
- You've got money.
- Traveler's checks.
Forget it, Frank. We have cash.
You probably got the checks
that don't work in France.
Did anyone order me a plain cheese?
Yeah. But if you want any...
...somebody's gonna have to barf it up
because it's gone.
Fuller! Go easy on the Pepsi.
Kev! Kev, get a plate.
- Passports!
- Watch it!
No, no. Get these passports
out of here.
Are you okay, honey? Come here.
Are you all right?
What is the matter with you?
He started it!
He ate my pizza on purpose.
He knows I hate sausage and olives...
Look what you did, you little jerk!
Get upstairs now.
Why?
You're such a disease.
- Shut up!
- Kevin, upstairs!
- Say good night, Kevin.
- "Good night, Kevin."
Why do I get treated like scum?
I'm sorry. This house is just crazy.
We've got all these extra kids
running around.
My brother's in from Ohio.
It's nuts.
How come you didn't bring
more cheese pizzas?
Nice tip. Thanks.
Having a reunion?
My husband's brother transferred
to Paris. His kids are still here.
He missed the family,
so he invited us to Paris...
...so we'll be together.
You're taking a trip to Paris?
Yes, we leave tomorrow morning.
Excellent. Excellent.
If you'll excuse me, this one's
a little out of sorts.
Don't worry about me.
I spoke to your husband.
And don't worry about your home.
It's in good hands.
There are 15 people, and only you
have to make trouble.
I'm getting dumped on.
You're the only one acting up.
Now get upstairs.
I am upstairs, dummy!
The third floor?
- Go.
- It's scary up there.
Fuller'll be up in a little while.
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.
He wets the bed.
He'll pee all over me. I know it.
We'll put him somewhere else.
I'm sorry.
It's too late. Get upstairs.
Everyone in this family hates me!
Then ask Santa for a new family.
I don't want a new family. I don't
want any family. Families suck!
Stay up there. I don't want
to see you again tonight.
I don't want to see you
for the rest of my life.
I don't want to see
anybody else either.
I hope you don't mean that.
You'd feel pretty sad if you woke up
and didn't have a family.
No, I wouldn't.
Then say it again.
Maybe it'll happen.
I hope I never see any
of you jerks again!
I wish they would all just disappear.
- Where are they?
- I don't know. She said 8 sharp.
Peter!
We slept in!
Hi, I'm Mitch Murphy.
I live across the street.
You guys going out of town?
We're going to Florida.
Well, first we're going to Missouri
to pick up my grandma.
You know the McCallisters
are going to France?
Do you know if it's cold?
- Do these vans get good mileage?
- Kid, I don't know. Hit the road!
Do a head count.
Get everyone in the vans.
Where are the passports?
I put them in the microwave to dry.
How fast does this go?
Does it have automatic transmission?
Does it have 4-wheel drive?
Look, I told you before, kid.
Don't bother me. Now, beat it!
Line up in front of the van.
- Line up and shut up!
- Wow!
Shut up!
I need a head count.
One, two, three...
Eleven, 92, 12...
Buzz, don't be a moron.
Six, seven, eight...
...nine, 10, 11.
Okay, half in this van,
half in this one. Let's go.
Have a good trip.
Bring me back something French.
There's no way we'll make this plane.
It leaves in 45 minutes.
Think positive!
You be positive.
I'll be realistic.
Excuse me, your power is fixed...
...but the phones are a mess.
It'll take a couple of days to fix...
...especially around the holidays.
- Thanks.
Did you count heads?
Eleven, including me.
Five boys, six girls,
two drivers...
...and a partridge in a pear tree.
Hold the plane!
- Did we miss it?
- You just made it.
Single seats only in coach.
Take whatever's free.
I get a window seat!
- Kids are in coach, we're first class.
- Seats Four A and B.
Four A and B. I'll take your coats.
- Fasten your seat belts.
- Champagne, please.
- It's free, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.
We made it.
Do you believe it?
Hope we didn't forget anything.
Mom?
- That's real. It's real crystal.
- Yeah, so?
- Put them in your purse.
- Frank, I can't do that.
Just... Put them in your purse!
Yeah. Fill it up.
Fill it up.
Fill it up, please.
Thank you.
Don't you feel like a heel, flying
first class with the kids in coach?
No. The kids are fine.
The only time I ever flew as a kid was
in the station wagon, not to France.
We had to go to Aunt Laura
and Uncle Arthur's.
Kids are okay. They're having
the time of their lives.
Hello?
Mom?
Dad?
Where are you guys?
Buzz?
Megan?
Hello?
Rod?
Uncle Frank?
Uncle Frank, is this a joke?
Megan? Linnie?
Is this a joke?
It's only my imagination.
Only my imagination.
The cars are still here.
They didn't go to the airport!
I made my family disappear.
You're completely helpless.
You know, Kevin...
... you're what the French call
les incompetents.
Kevin, I'm going to feed you
to my tarantula.
Kevin, you are such a disease.
There are 15 people, and you're
the only one who has to make trouble.
Look what you did, you little jerk!
I made my family disappear.
I'm free!
Wow!
No clothes on anybody.
Sickening!
Cool! Firecrackers!
I'll save these for later.
Buzz, I'm going through
all your private stuff.
You better come out and pound me!
Buzz, your girlfriend! Woof!
Who is it?
It's me. Snakes.
I got the stuff.
Leave it on the doorstep
and get the hell out of here.
All right, Johnny,
but what about my money?
What money?
A.C. Said you had some dough for me.
Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?
A.C. Said ten percent.
Too bad A.C. Ain't in charge no more.
Guys, I'm eating junk
and watching rubbish!
You better come out and stop me!
He'll call you when he gets out.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna
give you.
I'm gonna give you to
the count of ten...
... to get your ugly, yellow...
... no-good keister off my property...
... before I pump your guts
full of lead.
All right, I'm sorry.
I'm going.
One, two... ten.
Keep the change,
you filthy animal.
Mom!
What's the matter?
Honey?
I have a terrible feeling.
About what?
That we didn't do something.
You feel that way because
we left in a hurry.
We took care of everything.
Did I turn off the coffee?
No.
I did.
Did you lock up?
Yeah.
Did you close the garage?
That's it.
I forgot to close the garage.
That's it.
No, that's not it.
What else could we be forgetting?
Kevin!
The captain's doing all he can.
Your phones are out of order.
We'll call when we land.
I'm sure it's okay.
Horrible. Horrible.
Just horrible.
How could we do this?
We forgot him.
We didn't forget him,
we just miscounted.
What kind of mother am I?
If it makes you feel any better,
I forgot my reading glasses.
Five families gone
on one block alone.
They all told me from their
own mouths.
It's almost too easy.
Check it out:
All the houses with nobody home...
...have automatic timers
on their lights.
But I got it all figured out.
Watch this.
Number 664 will be going on
right about...
...now.
Wait, wait, wait.
Number 682...
...right now.
Wait a minute.
...now.
And that's the one, Marvin.
That's the silver tuna.
It's very G.
Very G, huh? It's loaded.
It's got lots of top-flight goods.
- Stereos, VCRs...
- Toys?
Probably looking at some
very fine jewelry.
Possible cash horde.
Odd marketable securities.
Who knows? It's a gem.
Grab your crowbar.
Crowbars up.
You're a rotter,
Mr. Grinch
You're the king
Of sinful sots
Your heart's a dead tomato
Blotched with moldy purple spots,
Mr. Grinch
Which way?
We'll go around back,
down the basement.
- You said they were gone.
- They were gonna leave today.
Let's get out of here.
We have to use the phone, please.
It's an emergency.
We really have to make a call.
Please! Our brother's home alone.
Give us the phone!
I'm sorry. Thank you.
I'm calling the police.
Book us a flight home.
Get change out of here.
Call everybody you know.
Here's my address book. You and Frank
call everyone on our street.
Maybe somebody can help us.
Hello? Hello?
Oh, she'll have to call you back.
This is ridiculous.
Only a wimp would be
hiding under a bed.
And I can't be a wimp.
I'm the man of the house.
Hey, I'm not afraid anymore!
I said, I'm not afraid anymore!
Do you hear me?
I'm not afraid anymore.
Village police department.
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.
I'd like somebody to go there. Tell
him that we're coming home to get him.
Okay, let me connect you
with Family Crisis Intervention.
Hold on.
Larry, can you pick up?
There's some hyper lady on hold.
- What line, Rose?
- Two.
Family Crisis Intervention,
Sergeant Balzac.
I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone.
Has the child been involved in
violence with a drunk family member?
No!
Has he been involved
in a household accident?
I don't know. I hope not.
Has the child ingested any poison
or is an object lodged in his throat?
No, he's home alone! I'd like
somebody to go over to the house...
...and see if he's all right.
You want us to go to your house,
just to check on him.
Yes!
Let me connect you to the police.
They just transferred me.
- Rose!
- Yeah.
- Hyper.
- Hang on.
- Hold on, please.
- No, please don't hang up. Please!
Any luck?
- I couldn't get anybody.
- Leslie?
Nothing but a bunch
of answering machines.
Somebody pick up. Pick up!
Oh, hi, ma'am. It's you again.
Look, I'm calling from Paris.
I have a son who's home alone, and l...
We'll send a policeman over
to your house to check on your son.
There's nobody home.
The house looks secure.
Tell them to count their kids again.
You can't bump somebody or ask or...?
There's no way I can do that.
Isn't there a way
if you ask somebody?
If you said it's an emergency...
I cannot ask them.
She's sending a policeman
over to the house.
Well, that's a relief.
Everything here is booked.
Nothing to Chicago?
There's nothing to Chicago,
New York, Nashville.
- What about a private plane?
- Sorry. We don't do that.
The only thing is a booking
for us on Friday morning.
Friday morn... That's two days away.
The kids are exhausted and so are you.
There's nothing we can do here.
I say we go over to Rob's, and that
way we can call the police again.
I'm not leaving here unless
it's on an airplane.
Madame, we are doing
everything we can.
If you want to stay at the airport,
maybe we can get you on standby.
It is a possibility
that a seat will open up.
- Is that okay?
- Yes. I'll wait.
I'll miss you, honey.
Don't you get lost.
Goodbye.
I took a shower, washing every
body part with actual soap.
Including all my major crevices...
...between my toes
and in my belly button...
...which I never did before
but enjoyed.
I washed my hair with adult formula
shampoo and used creme rinse.
I can't find my toothbrush,
so I'll pick one up today.
Other than that, I'm in good shape.
All right! Buzz's life savings.
I thought the Murphys
went to Florida.
You're one of the great
cat burglars of the world.
You think you can keep it
down a little in there?
You've reached the Murphy's.
Please leave a message after the beep.
This is Peter McCallister again.
We're in Paris at my brother's.
Let me give you the number here.
The country code is 33.
The area code is 1-4 and the number
is 694-876...
- Hey, Harry.
- Yeah?
That house we ran last night,
was that the McCallister's?
- Call me in Paris.
- You're right. They're gone.
- I knew they were.
- Silver tuna tonight.
Wow!
How may I help you?
Is this toothbrush approved
by the American Dental Association?
Well, I don't know.
It doesn't say, hon.
Can you please find out?
- Herb.
- Yeah?
I got a question here
about a toothbrush.
Do you know, is this brush approved
by the American Dental Association?
I don't know.
Oh, hon, you pay for that here.
Wait, you have to pay for that.
Son! Son!
Jimmy, stop that boy!
Hey!
Shoplifter!
Hey! Hey, kid!
Come back here!
Stop it, will you?
Come here.
I'm a criminal.
What's so funny?
What's so funny?
Why are you laughing?
You did it again.
You left the water running.
Why do you do that?
I told you not to do it.
- It's our calling card.
- Calling card.
All the great ones leave their mark.
We're the wet bandits.
You're sick, you know?
You're really sick.
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.
It's a sick thing to do.
- We don't need that.
- Don't tell me...
I can do it if I want to.
It's not sick. Hey, watch out!
Hey! Hey!
You've gotta watch for traffic.
- Sorry.
- Damn.
Santy don't visit
the funeral homes, buddy.
Okay, okay.
Merry Christmas.
What's the matter?
I don't like the way
that kid looked at me.
- Ever seen him before?
- I saw a hundred kids this week.
Let's see what house he goes into.
Why's he going faster?
I told you something's wrong.
He looked at me weird.
Why would he run?
Maybe he went in the church.
- I'm not going in there.
- Me neither.
Let's get out of here.
When those guys come back,
I'll be ready.
Did they come back?
From Paris?
We'll come back tomorrow.
Maybe they'll be gone.
We better go before somebody sees us.
Look what I found in the kitchen.
Frank, those are for later.
Do you want a little shrimp, huh?
Do you speak English?
Well, is there...
- Did you get anybody?
- I am looking for my son!
No, I can't find anybody.
They're all shopping.
Nobody's home for the holidays.
Never mind, forget it.
- This is so pointless.
- What?
We're here rotting in this apartment.
Kevin's at home.
Mom's at the airport.
- So?
- You're not worried about Kevin?
Why should I be? He acted like a jerk
and now he caught it in the butt.
He's so little and helpless.
Don't you think he's freaked?
The trout can use a couple of days
in the real world.
You're not worried
something might happen?
No. For three reasons:
A. I'm not that lucky.
Two: We have smoke detectors...
...and D: We live in the most boring
street in the United States...
...where nothing even remotely
dangerous will ever happen. Period.
Who is it?
It's Little Nero's.
I have your pizza.
Leave it on the doorstep
and get out of here.
Okay.
What about the money?
What money?
Well, you have to pay
for your pizza, sir.
Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?
That'll be $11.80, sir.
Keep the change, you filthy animal.
- Cheapskate.
- Hey.
I'm gonna give you
to the count of ten...
... to get your ugly, yellow...
... no-good keister
off my property...
... before I pump you full of lead.
One, two... ten.
A lovely cheese pizza, just for me.
- To Dallas/Forth Worth.
American Airlines...
So we have the $500,
the pocket translator...
...the two first-class seats,
that's an upgrade...
Is that a real Rolex?
- Do you think it is?
- No.
But who can tell?
I also have a ring.
Oh, that is beautiful!
They're boarding.
She's offered us two first-class
tickets if we go Friday.
Plus a ring, a watch,
a pocket translator, $500 and...
The earrings.
She's got her own earrings.
A whole shoebox full of them.
- Come on, come on.
- No, but...
I'm desperate.
I'm begging you.
From a mother to a mother. Please!
- Oh, Ed.
- Please!
Oh, all right.
"Dear Santa, I got a little sister
last year.
This year I'd rather have
some Clay-Doh. "
I didn't mean it.
If you come back, I'll never be
a pain in the butt again.
I promise. Good night.
I'm dreaming
Of a white
Christmas
Just like the ones
I used to know
Where those treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells
In the snow
The snow
Are those microwave dinners good?
- I don't know.
- I'll give them a whirl.
For the kids.
Hold on, I got a coupon for that.
It was in the paper this morning.
$19.83.
Okay.
Are you here all by yourself?
Ma'am, I'm 8 years old.
You think I'd be here alone?
I don't think so.
Where's your mom?
- In the car.
- Where's your dad?
- He's at work.
- What about brothers and sisters?
I'm an only child.
- Where do you live?
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?
- Cause you're a stranger.
Hello, Kevin!
Shut up!
I don't get it.
It looks like there's nobody's home.
Last night the place is jumping.
Something ain't right.
Go check it out.
Now?
No, tomorrow, egghead!
Now! Go ahead.
"Now."
Shit!
Get the hell out of here.
All right, Johnny.
But what about my money?
What money?
A.C. Said you had
some dough for me.
Is that a fact?
How much do I owe you?
A.C. Said ten percent.
Too bad A.C.
Ain't in charge no more.
What do you mean?
He's upstairs, taking a bath.
He'll call you when he gets out.
Hey, I tell you what I'm
gonna give you, Snakes.
- Snakes?
- I'll give you to the count of ten...
... to get your ugly,
yellow, no-good...
... keister off my property...
... before I pump you full of lead.
All right, Johnny. I'm sorry.
I'm going.
One, two... ten.
Keep the change, you filthy animal.
What happened?
I don't know who, but somebody
just got blown away.
Somebody beat us,
they're in there.
Two of them.
There was arguing.
One blew the other one away.
- Who?
- I don't know.
I recognized one of their voices.
I heard that name "Snakes" before.
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.
I don't know no Snakes.
Snakes. Let's get out of here.
Hold it. Hold it.
Let's wait and see who it is.
We work this neighborhood too.
Suppose the cops finger us
for a job...
...and they ask us about
a murder in the area.
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a face to go with it?
That's a good idea.
Of course it's a good idea.
Snakes?
He sounded like a snake.
Everything's full.
Everything's full?
I'm very sorry, but
it is Christmas Eve.
What about another airline?
Nothing available.
May I help you get a hotel room?
Tomorrow we can get you a flight.
I can't wait that long.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we're
doing absolutely everything we can.
I'm in your way. I'm sorry.
You've places to go.
Got a ticket there, good. Excuse me.
Look, I have been awake
for almost 60 hours.
I'm tired and I'm dirty.
I have been from Chicago to Paris,
to Dallas, to... Where am I?
Scranton.
I'm trying to get home
to my 8-year-old son.
Now you're telling me it's hopeless?
- I'm sorry.
- No. No way.
This is Christmas!
The season of perpetual hope.
If I have to get on
your runway and hitchhike...
...if it costs me everything I own...
...if I have to sell my soul
to the Devil himself...
...I am going to get home to my son.
Ma'am, if there was anything...
Do it. Do anything.
- I can get you a hotel room.
- What?
Can you excuse us for a sec?
Can I see you for a second, please?
Excuse us.
You got a little bit of a dilemma.
We got a crisis ourselves.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Gus Polinski.
Polka King of the Midwest?
The Kenosha Kickers?
- Hi there.
- Hiya.
That's okay. I thought you might
have recognized...
I had a few hits a few years ago.
That's why I just...
"Polka, Polka, Polka"?
Polka, polka, polka
"Twin Lakes Polka"?
"Yamahoozie Polka," a.k.a.
"Kiss Me Polka"? "Polka Twist"?
These are songs?
Yeah. Yeah, we...
Some fairly big hits for us.
You know, in the early '80s.
Yeah, we sold about 623
copies of that.
- In Chicago?
- No, Sheboygan.
Very big in Sheboygan.
Did you say you could help?
Anyway, I'm rambling on here.
Our flight was canceled...
...so we're gonna drive. See the guy
in the yellow jacket over there?
He's gonna rent us a nice big van
to drive to Milwaukee.
Now, I heard you had some problems
getting to Chicago?
To see your kid or something?
Uh, my son. He...
We left, and he's there.
If you have to get to Chicago,
we'll gladly drive you.
It's on the way to Milwaukee.
- You'd give me a ride?
- Sure, why not?
You've got to get home.
- A ride to Chicago?
- Sure, it's Christmastime.
Thank you. Oh, thank you.
You don't mind going with polka bums?
No, I'd love to.
Hey, Marv. Marv, Marv!
Look at this.
I think we're getting scammed
by a kindergartner.
Dad, can you come here
and help me?
Remember that kid
we saw the other day?
He lives here.
If the kid's here,
the parent's got to be.
He's home alone.
What? You want to come
back tonight?
Even with the kid here?
I don't think that's a good idea.
That house is the reason
we worked this block.
Ever since I saw that house,
I wanted it.
Let's take it one step at a time.
We'll unload the van, get a bite
to eat, we'll come back about 9:00.
Nine o'clock.
This way it's dark then.
Yeah, kids are scared of the dark.
You're afraid of the dark too.
You know you are.
No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.
- Not, not, not.
You are so.
Mom, where are you?
Do you play?
Do you want to try? Go ahead,
try it. Try it!
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?
Hey, nice shoes.
Oh, thanks.
Is he still here? It's really
important that I see him.
He's getting in his car.
If you hurry, you can catch him.
How low! Giving Kriss Kringle
a parking ticket on Christmas Eve!
What's next, rabies shots
for the Easter Bunny?
Santa, hold on.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Quickly.
Santa's running late.
I know you're not
the real Santa Claus.
Huh, what makes you say that?
Just out of curiosity.
- I'm old enough to know how it works.
- All right.
But I also know you work for him.
- I'd like you to give him a message.
- Shoot.
Kevin McCallister, 681 Lincoln Blvd.
Do you need the phone number?
No, that's all right.
This is extremely important.
Please tell him instead of presents,
I just want my family back.
No toys. Nothing but Peter, Kate,
Buzz, Megan, Linnie and Jeff.
And my aunt and my cousins.
And if he has time,
my Uncle Frank. Okay?
Okay.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks.
Wait. My elf took the last of the
candy canes home to her boyfriend.
- That's okay.
- No, don't be silly.
Everybody who sees Santa
has got to get something.
Here, hold out your little paw there.
There you go.
- Don't spoil your dinner.
- I won't.
Thanks.
Son of a...!
Merry Christmas.
May I sit down?
That's my granddaughter.
The little red-haired girl.
She's about your age.
You know her?
No.
You live next to me, don't you?
You can say hello when you see me.
You don't have to be afraid.
There's a lot of things going around
about me, but none of it's true. Okay?
- You've been good this year?
- I think so.
You swear to it?
No.
Yeah. Well, this is the place to be
if you're feeling bad about yourself.
- It is?
- I think so.
- Are you feeling bad about yourself?
- No.
I've been kind of a pain lately.
I said some things I shouldn't have.
I really haven't been
too good this year.
Yeah.
I'm kind of upset
because I really like my family.
Even though sometimes I say I don't.
Sometimes I even think I don't.
- Do you get that?
- I think so.
How you feel about family
is a complicated thing.
Especially with an older brother.
Deep down, you'll always love him.
But you can forget that you love him.
You can hurt them, they can hurt you.
That's not just because you're young.
You want to know the real
reason why I'm here?
Sure.
I came to hear my granddaughter sing.
I can't come hear her tonight.
You have plans?
No.
I'm not welcome.
At church?
You're always welcome at church.
I'm not welcome with my son.
Years back, before you and your family
moved on the block...
...I had an argument with my son.
How old is he?
He's grown up.
We lost our tempers, and I said
I didn't care to see him anymore.
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?
I'm afraid if I call,
he won't talk to me.
How do you know?
I don't know.
I'm just afraid.
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?
You can be old for a lot of things.
- You're never too old to be afraid.
- That's true.
I was afraid of our basement.
It's dark. There's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.
Basements are like that.
I made myself go down
to do some laundry...
...and I found out it's not so bad.
I worried about it, but if you
turn on the lights, it's no big deal.
What's your point?
My point is,
you should call your son.
- What if he won't talk to me?
- At least you'll know.
Then you could stop worrying about it.
You won't have to be afraid anymore.
No matter how mad I was, I'd talk to
Dad. Especially around the holidays.
I don't know.
Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.
I'm sure she misses you.
And the presents.
I send her a check.
I wish my grandparents did that.
They always send me clothes.
Last year I got a sweater
with a bird knitted on it.
Oh, that's nice.
Not for a guy in the second grade.
You can get beat up for wearing
something like that.
I have a friend who got nailed...
...because there was a rumor
he wore dinosaur pajamas.
You better run home where you belong.
Think about what I said.
- All right?
- Okay.
It's nice talking to you.
Nice talking to you.
- What about you?
- Me?
Yeah. You and your son.
We'll see what happens.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
This is my house.
I have to defend it.
We'll check it out.
We can come back for the truck.
How do you want to go in?
We'll go to the back door.
Maybe he'll let us in.
Yeah, he's a kid. Kids are stupid.
Bless this nutritious, microwaveable
macaroni and cheese dinner...
...and the people who sold
it on sale.
This is it. Don't get scared now.
Merry Christmas, little fella.
We know that you're in there,
and that you're all alone.
Yeah, come on, kid. Open up.
It's Santy Claus and his elf.
We're not gonna hurt you.
No, no. Got some nice
presents for you.
Be a good little fella now
and open the door.
What?
What? What?
What?
- What happened?
- Get that little...
Hello.
Yes! Yes!
The little jerk is armed!
That's it! I'm going in the front.
You go down the basement!
Oh, boy. That's it, you little...
You little...
No, not this time, you little brat.
You little creep, where are you?
Yes!
- Rip his head off...!
You're dead, kid.
Where are you, you little creep?!
Harry, I'm coming in!
Oh, no! I'm really scared.
It's too late for you, kid, we're
in the house. We're gonna get you.
Okay, come and get me!
Why, you...!
Now you're dead!
I'm gonna kill that kid!
Why'd you take your shoes off?
Why are you dressed like a chicken?
I'm up here, you morons.
Come and get me.
You guys give up, or are you
thirsty for more?
Heads up!
Don't worry, Marv.
I'll get him for you.
Yes!
He's only a kid, Harry.
We can take him.
Ah, shut up, will you?
What is it?
You're missing some teeth.
Where? It's my gold tooth.
My gold tooth. I'll kill him.
I'll kill him!
You bomb me with
one more can, kid...
...and I'll snap off your cojones
and boil them in motor oil!
911 emergency.
Hello, my house is being robbed.
My address is 656 Lincoln Boulevard.
My name is Murphy.
You never know what's up there.
There he is!
I got you! I got him, Harry.
I got him.
Harry, give me a hand!
I got him!
Harry, help me. Get up!
I got him.
What are you doing?
Harry, don't move.
Don't move.
Marv, what are you doing?
Did I get him?
Did I get him?!
Where is it? Where is it?
Never mind that. Here!
How do you like it, huh? You jerk!
Get that kid, before l...
Get that kid!
Where'd he go?
Maybe he committed suicide.
Down here, you big horse's ass!
Come get me before I call the police.
- Let's get him!
- Wait, wait.
It's just what he wants us to do:
Go back through his fun house
so we get all tore up.
He's gonna call the cops!
From a tree house?!
Come on.
Out the window?
I'm not going out the window.
Why, you scared? Are you afraid?
Come on, get out here.
Come on.
Come on!
- Come on. Keep going.
- Let's go back, Harry.
Shut it, Marv.
Hey, guys!
Check this out.
Go back. Go back.
There he is!
Hey, I'm calling the cops!
Wait, wait!
He wants us to follow him.
I got a better idea. Come on.
Hiya, pal.
We outsmarted you this time.
Get over here!
What are you gonna do, Harry?
I'll do exactly what he did to us.
Burn his head with a blowtorch.
I'll smash his face with an iron.
I'd like to slap him
in the face with a paint can!
Shove a nail through his foot!
I'm gonna bite off every one of
these little fingers, one at a time.
Come on. Let's get you home.
Wow! This is great.
Nice move,
leaving the water running.
Now we know each and every house
that you've hit.
We've been looking for you guys
for a long time.
Yeah. Well, remember,
we're the "Wet Bandits."
- Wet Bandits, that's W-E-T...
- Shut up! Get in the car!
Hey, come on. Come on.
- Hand off the head, pal!
- Come on.
I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.
No, you're not.
You're beating yourself up there.
This happens.
These things happen, you know.
You want to talk about bad parents?
Look at us.
We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year.
We hardly see our families.
Joe, over there. Gosh, you know...
...he forgets his kids' names
half the time.
Ziggy over there,
he's never even met his kid.
Eddy... Let's just hope
none of them write a book about him.
Tell me, have you gone on vacation
and left your child home?
No.
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.
Yeah, it was terrible too.
I was all distraught and everything.
The wife and I, we left the little
tyke there in the funeral parlor.
All day. You know, we went
back at night, when we...
...came to our senses,
there he was.
Apparently, he was there
all day with a corpse.
Now, he was okay.
You know, after six, seven weeks.
He came around
and started talking again.
They get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.
We shouldn't talk about this.
I was just trying to cheer you up.
I'm sorry I did.
Mom?
Mom?
Kevin!
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.
Where's everybody else?
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.
They wanted to so much...
I didn't fall asleep in the back
and drool all over you, did I?
- You do drool!
- Shut up!
Kevin, my boy. How are you?
You're all right.
I love you. You okay?
It's cool that you didn't
burn the place down.
Thanks, Buzz.
Wait a minute.
How'd you guys get home?
On the morning flight you didn't
want to wait for.
- Oh, no. Oh! Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Someone has to find an open store.
I went shopping yesterday.
You, shopping?
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.
- What?
- No kidding?
What a funny guy.
What else did you do
while we were away?
Just hung around.
Bring your stuff upstairs.
He went shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe. He's going shopping?
Honey, what's this?
Kevin! What did you do
to my room?

Hey, Brennan.
Mom, I'm watching the thing
with the lady.
I'm leaving. Okay?
I'll be home around 11.
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Brennan.
Let's slowly get those hips up.
Good. Now, hold it right here. Great.
Dale.
Dale, I'm leaving for the conference.
- You leave me money for pizza, Dad?
- Yeah, there's $20 on the hall table.
Do not order pay-per-view, buddy.
- But what if I want wings?
- You don't need wings.
That's not enough, Dad!
The RTI cochlear implant...
...is the state-of-the-art
implantable hearing device...
...due to its input processing of sound
via the speech processor.
But the most exciting
new development...
...is the external processor...
...which fits directly over the ear...
...which eliminates the need to put
your face between those breasts.
I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm so lost.
And this never happens to me.
My name is Robert, and I play
racquetball. I collect coins.
Sweet Jesus! I love Korean food.
I am Nancy Huff. I know
how to make tandoori chicken...
...I contribute to NPR
every single year...
...and I love the movies
of Rob Reiner.
Pilates changed my life.
I have a boat, and I wanna retire
and sail around the world.
- I love the sea!
- And I drive a Mercedes...
...and I have a 40-year-old son, Dale,
who still lives at home.
- What did you just say?
- I knew I shouldn't have told you that.
I have a 39-year-old son
named Brennan...
...who still lives at home with me.
I would like to thank all of you...
...for being here with us
on this fantastic, wonderful day.
And I would like to raise my glass.
Dale and I wanna welcome you
to our home with open arms.
- Get a room, Dad.
- Oh, for chri... Dale!
Well, as you all know, my youngest
son, Derek, couldn't be here...
...because of an important
fishing trip.
But my other son, Brennan, was going
to be moving into his own place...
...but he was recently let go
from his job at PetSmart...
...so he is gonna be living with us.
I wasn't fired from my job,
I was laid off!
But you wouldn't
know the difference.
I didn't want salmon!
I said it four times.
This wedding is horseshit.
Somebody's awfully quiet
back there.
I'm not gonna call him Dad.
Brennan, you're 39 years old.
I would not expect you
to call him Dad.
Well, I'm not going to, ever.
Even if there's a fire.
Robert better not get in my face...
...because I'll drop
that motherfucker.
Jesus, Brennan.
I'm just saying, I think
you gotta think about your options.
I know that you are
technically married now...
...but that does not mean
that they have to live here.
Dale, I think it's time for a change
for both of us.
Dad, we're men, okay?
That means a few things.
We like to shit with the door open.
We talk about pussy.
We go on riverboat-gambling trips.
We make our own beef jerky.
That's what we do.
And now that is all wrecked.
We literally have never done
any of those things.
Where did he go to medical school?
He went to Northwestern
and Johns Hopkins.
- Is that good enough for you?
- No, it's not.
Well, Brennan, those are
very prestigious schools.
I smoked pot with Johnny Hopkins.
You don't know anyone
named Johnny Hopkins.
It was Johnny Hopkins
and Sloan Kettering...
...and they were
blazing that shit up every day.
All right, here's a scenario
for you, Dad.
Suppose Nancy sees me
coming out of the shower...
...and decides to come on to me.
I'm looking good.
I've got a luscious V of hair...
...going from my chest pubes
down to my ball-fro.
And she takes one look at me,
and she goes:
"Oh, my God.
I've had the old bull,
now I want the young calf."
- And she grabs me by the wiener.
- Shut the fuck up!
- Come on, Brennan.
- I'm fine here.
- There you are.
- Hi.
Oh, you look so cute
in your moving clothes.
- How was it?
- It was easy.
The movers did everything.
Where's Brennan?
He's still in the car.
It was kind of a rough drive.
Hey, Robert,
what's all the commotion?
- Hey, Don.
- Is that your wife, Nancy?
- Right here, Don.
- Can I come over this afternoon...
...and touch your face?
- Sure.
Thanks. Good luck, guys.
We'll see you, Don.
Let's go, Cinnamon.
Heel, Cinnamon.
Heel! Cinnamon!
Cinnamon!
Hi, Dale.
Hey, Nancy. Could you make me
a grilled-cheese sandwich?
- Sure.
- No.
Dale just ate. He's testing you to see
how much he can get away with.
- I see.
- I'm hungry.
Look in your right hand.
- I sure don't mind a bit. I really don't.
- No, no.
No, no. He's fine.
Hey.
Hey.
I'm Brennan.
I'm Dale.
But you have to call me Dragon.
You have to call me Nighthawk.
Brennan.
Please don't do that.
Now, that's enough ketchup.
Come on. Dale.
- I like it.
- That's enough.
Dale, I don't know if you...
You might wanna try this. I make
a sauce, we call it "fancy sauce"...
For me.
- that Brennan really likes
with his chicken nuggets.
It's my fancy sauce.
Well, when Brennan finishes,
I'll give you some of this, and it's...
It's ketchup and mayonnaise
mixed together, so...
It's so good.
- I want some fancy sauce.
- Yeah.
- I'm not done using it.
- Looks good.
- Can I have fancy sauce?
- Of course. Of course.
- I'm using it right now.
- Okay.
- So let's just let him try some.
- You wanna try it, Dale?
Yeah, I really would like some.
Just one last spoonful.
Hey, I think you've got
enough there, Brennan.
- So here you go.
- Thanks.
It's ketchup and mayonnaise.
- I don't like it. It smells weird.
- Okay.
- I'll try some.
- You want some?
- Sure. Absolutely.
- Okay.
You don't mind, do you, Brennan?
No. Okay.
- Brennan...
- I'm not comfortable...
It's okay. It's probably
not good on fish anyway.
My dad's king of the castle, so if he
wants fancy sauce, he should...
- No, it's all right, Dale.
- He can make his own batch.
So you know what?
Today, when you were driving around,
Dale was telling me that he's really...
...into kung fu, and I was telling him
that you're really into kung fu as well.
I have a green belt.
Read it and weep.
I don't believe in belts.
There should be no
ranking system for toughness.
But one time I wrestled a giraffe
to the ground with my bare hands.
That's not true, Dale.
Don't be ridiculous.
So, Dale, what have you been
working on recently?
Well...
...I manage a baseball team.
- Little League?
- Fantasy league.
Take a picture. It'll last longer.
Why don't you stop
being so confrontational, Dale?
I'm not the one staring at me.
So, Brennan, how about you?
I know you used to
work at PetSmart.
- That's right, Mr. Doback.
- Call me Robert.
- That's right, Robin.
- Robert.
Robin.
Actually, Brennan
is a really talented person.
He's a very gifted singer.
- I'm really, really good.
- How good?
I've been called
the songbird of my generation...
...by people who've heard me.
That good.
The only trick is
is that Brennan's very...
...particular about
who he sings in front of, so...
I'm his mom, for example,
I've only heard him sing twice.
That's funny that you say that,
because I can sing too.
In fact, I'll sing right now.
If you wanna get down
On these hairy balls
- Hey!
- Why don't you jump right in?
It's a crotch party right up in here
- Stop it!
- Why don't you lick on this big joint?
Stop it, Dale! Stop it! Stop it!
That's cute.
I remember when I had my first beer.
That's so funny,
the last time I heard that...
...I laughed so hard
I fell off my dinosaur.
Stop right now. All right?
Let's just back off.
All right. Brennan, it's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, hey.
- Great, Dale.
- He said a mean thing first.
All right, just...
Look, you know what...? Hey, guys.
Okay, sleeping arrangements.
It's gonna be different...
...but because Dale refuses
to give up his office drum set...
...that means that, Brennan, you and
Dale are gonna have to share a room.
- But it's just temporary.
- Mom, we didn't talk about this.
Well, it's gonna be
an exciting adventure.
You wanna show him the room, Dale?
Show him where he can put his stuff?
- That's nice, thank you.
- Good night, Nancy.
Hey, listen, I like to have
a lot of fresh fruit around...
...and chocolate chips
in my pancakes. Okay?
- Write it so you don't forget.
- Show him the room.
She's Mom now, so...
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, Brennan.
- Good night, Mr. Doback.
- Good night, Brennan.
So just a few basic rules
about the house.
If there's any foods that you like...
...I suggest you put your name
on them, or they will be thrown out.
By me.
House was built in 1825
by General Custer.
I wanna show you this room.
Hold up.
- You see this room?
- Yeah.
Okay, here's the deal.
This is my office
and my beat laboratory.
Okay?
And this is the one rule of the house:
Don't ever, ever, ever...
...touch my drum set.
- You understand?
- Don't go in there and...
- No touching!
- All right!
There. I was at about six there.
You don't wanna see me go to 10.
Get your shit.
We're going to my room.
Honey?
I just found a chain of islands
that we can sail to after New Zealand.
That's wonderful.
You know,
I've been meaning to ask you...
Why is it that Dale never left?
Well, Dale has always
coasted off my accomplishments.
I mean, he left college
his junior year...
...because he said he wanted
to join the family business.
- But you're a medical doctor.
- Believe me, I've told him that.
But he just always says,
"It's all about who you know."
I don't know where
he got this sense of entitlement.
Maybe it was his mother passing.
What about Brennan?
From what you've told me...
...his younger brother Derek's
been quite successful.
Well, certainly when his father
and I split, that was difficult for him.
And this one time, when Brennan
was 17 and Derek was 14...
...and Brennan decided
to enter a talent show.
He sang a song
from an old pirate musical.
But Derek got his football buddies
to replace the choir and sing:
"Brennan has a mangina."
Brennan has a mangina
Brennan has a mangina
Finally, the audience and even some
of the nastier parents started singing:
"Brennan has a mangina."
And I have to admit, for a little while,
I sort of joined in as well.
From that day on,
Brennan never sang again.
Derek went on to win the contest
by lip-synching "Ice Ice Baby."
- Oh, that's a great song.
- It is.
- Hey, you awake?
- Yeah.
I just want you to know I hate you.
So does my dad.
Well, that's fine.
Because guess what.
I hate you too.
And this house sucks ass.
Well, the only reason
you're living here...
...is because me and my dad decided
that your mom was really hot...
...and maybe we should just
both bang her.
And we'll put up with the retard
in the meantime.
- Who's the retard?
- You.
- Hey, y'all don't say that.
- Shut up.
You'll wake up my dad
and get me grounded.
Just shut up.
You and your mom are hillbillies.
- This is a house of learned doctors.
- You're not a doctor.
You're a big, fat, curly-headed fuck.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- I'm a curly-headed fuck?
- Yeah.
You better not go to sleep.
As soon as your eyes shut, I'm gonna
punch you square in the face.
I hope you stay still
when you sleep...
...because I'm putting a rat trap
between your legs.
I'm gonna take a pillowcase
and fill it full of bars of soap...
...and beat the shit out of you.
I want you out of my fucking house.
No way, kemosabe.
This is my house now.
How do you like The Gilded Lady?
I wish we could retire right now.
Won't be long.
Oh, God! It's cold!
Hey! Is anyone listening? Help!
Fuck you, Dale! Fuck you!
- obviously you guys are hot.
You know?
Just revealed her cover.
I was like, "Wow, this is hot."
A little girl-on-girl.
A little heaven, a little hell.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Why you so sweaty?
- I was watching Cops.
Not supposed to have
your feet on the couch.
Hey, man.
Did you touch my drum set?
- Nope.
- It's just weird...
...because seems like someone
definitely touched my drum set.
Yeah, that is weird.
Because I didn't touch them.
- Hey! Did you touch my drum set?
- Hey, knock it off!
I know you touched my drumstick,
because the left one has a chip in it.
You fucking crazy, man?
You sound insane, do you realize
that? You should be medicated.
Fuck you, Brennan.
I know you touched my drum set.
I wanna hear that
dirty mouth admit it.
You get out of my face,
or I'm gonna roundhouse your ass.
You swear on your mom's life
that you didn't touch it!
I don't swear to shit!
That's because you fucking
touched my drum set...
...because I know
Cops doesn't start till 4.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going upstairs.
Because I'm gonna put my nut sack
on your drum set. Okay?
Don't you do that.
I am warning you right now:
If you touch my drums, I will
stab you in the neck with a knife!
If you even go in the room,
I will go ape-shit, you hear me?
Don't wanna miss a spot.
John Bonham's playing
"Moby Dick" for real!
I swear to God. I swear to God! No!
I warned you.
There's one rule in the house,
and you broke it!
I didn't touch your damn drum set!
I'm pre-diabetic!
You fucking fucker! I'm gonna
rub my balls on your mom's face!
Come back here!
I'll kill you! You son of a bitch!
Your drum set's a whore!
I teabagged your fucking drum set!
Well, my drum set's a guy,
so that makes you gay, you fucker!
I'll kill you!
I think it's gonna go
generic soon, okay?
- Line three.
- Oh, thanks, Miles.
Yeah.
Jules? Wait, what's wrong?
- Back!
- You touched my drum set, you fucker!
Stop it! Stop it!
- Rape! Rape! Rape!
- Stop it! Stop! Stop.
- Stay out of this, Nancy!
- Stop it, you guys.
- Oh, my God, you're hurting him!
- No, Nancy!
Cinnamon! Stop it!
My mom is being eaten by a dog,
there's nothing I can do!
- No, a story has a...
- Excuse me.
Dr. Doback, the phone's for you.
I think it's urgent.
Hello?
Robert, they're like animals!
I can't stop them!
Stop screaming. Please.
I'm on my way.
There seems to be some
savage fight going on...
...between my son and stepson,
so l...
Family issues, huh?
I don't believe in talking about
people's personal lives...
...behind their back.
You know nobody likes you, right?
Rape! Rape! Rape!
What's going on?
Robert! They won't... They won't...
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Dale, what...?
- Stay out of it, Dad!
- Stop it!
What the fucking fuck?
Someone got some air. Snap.
- I still hate you.
- Still hate you.
Such power. It's raw power.
What are you doing?
It's Shark Week.
Okay, here's the deal:
Number one, you will fix
the fucking drywall now.
Number two, you have one month to
find jobs or you're out on your asses.
I will arrange interviews for Monday,
and you will go!
Dad, why are you talking
to me like this? I'm your son.
I'm not buying that crap anymore.
Today I saw my own son
use a bicycle as a weapon.
You yelled "rape"
at the top of your lungs.
Mom, I honestly thought
I was gonna be raped for a second.
He had the craziest look in his eyes.
And at one point he said,
"Let's get it on."
That was about the fighting.
I'm so not a raper.
I didn't touch your drum set, okay?
I witnessed with my eyes
your testicles touching my drum set.
All right, that's it! That's it!
You two guys leave me no choice.
No television for a week.
- What?!
- What?!
- We are so serious, guys.
- You're fucking high!
Are you out of your mind?
This goes in Robert's wall safe
and it's gonna stay there.
- No!
- Okay.
- This house is a fucking prison!
- On planet Bullshit!
In the galaxy of
This Sucks Camel Dicks!
Hi! Aunt Carol. Aunt Carol.
- Hey.
- You can't catch me.
I gotcha.
I gotcha.
Aunt Carol's on fire!
I don't know where you learned it.
- Well, there's lots more where that...
- My God.
- Oh, no. What happened?
- What the...?
Oh, my God.
Maybe Dale left the back door open
and raccoons got in.
Nancy? Is this your purse
in the freezer?
Yes. It's Brennan.
He sleepwalks and he always
puts my purse in the freezer.
Dale sleepwalks too.
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not. Look in the oven.
- What's in the...? Couch pillows?
- Couch pillows.
Yeah, Dale.
Come on.
- It's okay.
- It's really hard.
It's gonna be fine.
They're gonna get jobs,
they'll be gone in a month. A month.
Guys.
- Guys. Guys!
- I'll kill you, Leonard Nimoy.
The clown has no penis.
What kind of dreams
are you guys having?
Hey, it's 12:30.
Brennan, your brother's
coming today, so get up.
- Today?
- Yep.
- Shit.
- What's your problem?
My little brother's even
a bigger asshole than you are.
All right, let's really nail it this time.
Here we go.
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four.
All right, Tommy, you're the oldest.
I'm counting on you. Come on.
Nice vibrato, buddy.
All right, all right, Alice, let's go.
Flat. It's so flat.
I can't even... You don't even
look good while you're singing.
The worst thing I've ever heard.
This is $ 1200 a week for
voice lessons, and this is what I get?
Okay, I'm gonna save it
with this solo.
I'm Derek
And I can sing high like this
And I can sing high
Jesus!
We were so sad you guys
couldn't come to the wedding.
- But we completely understand.
- Yeah.
You were busy fishing
with Mark Cuban.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Well, not just the Cubes...
...but we had Chris Daughtry,
Jeff Probst, super-chef Bobby Flay.
It was insane.
I mean, it was almost too much.
My God, that's impressive.
Yeah, we were down in the Gulf,
fishing bonito.
Robert, have you ever been down
to the Gulf on the bonito run?
Always wanted to.
I hear it's amazing.
- It is. It's gorgeous.
- Are bonito fish big?
What?
Don't interrupt
when he's telling a story.
- It's fine, Robert.
- I was asking about the story.
- What's this guy's deal?
- I don't know, son. It's okay.
Well, Dale, they are
what's called a trophy fish.
So, yeah, they're pretty big.
I'm sorry.
Anyway...
Oh, God, I'm sorry,
I forget where my story was going.
Damn it, Dale.
- No...
- Robert.
- What?
- What? I asked him.
No, he can join in, Robert.
It's really okay.
Well, I asked him twice
not to interrupt.
Gang, don't be mad at Dale for ruining
the story. And possibly the evening.
It's totally fine.
I have a lot more stories.
- Derek, that you do. That you do.
- Yeah.
- Guilty as charged with the stories.
- Oh, God, you're impressive.
Come on. I love talking to you.
From across the room,
I feel like we have a thing.
You and me, man. You're my
new stepdad. You're unbelievable.
- I never heard that laugh before.
- Dad, why are you acting so weird?
Oh, hey, by the way, guys,
where's my bro, Brennan?
You're right about your brother.
Total dick.
Told you.
You know what? I still hate you...
...but you got a pretty awesome
collection of nudie mags.
Yeah, I got them
from the '70s, '80s and '90s.
It's like masturbating
in a time machine.
Anyway, so I figure by the summer
of 2010, we can probably set sail.
But I think about it
every day of my life.
Let me ask you this, Bob,
why wait two years?
- Well, I gotta make more money.
- Okay, look.
I hear you, believe me.
But what if I were to tell you
that I could sell this house...
...for 30 percent above market?
- That'd be great. Could you do it?
- Yeah. In a heartbeat, Robby.
Look, I got my real-estate license
a few years back for shits and gigs.
I'd do it for four-fifths commish...
...because you know what really
gets my dick hard?
Helping out my friends.
That'd be fantastic.
That'd be fanta... Oh, my God.
- No, it would be kick-ass, bro.
- Oh, man.
Right there.
What about Dale and Brennan?
Because they haven't
even gotten jobs yet.
God, change the record.
Sweet!
Robert. Don't talk to me like that
in front of my son.
Oh, come on. We're talking about
our dream, the boat. Come on.
Yeah, it's our dream, but I think it
all needs to be done in good time.
I'm just saying give it some thought,
okay? That's it. That's all I'm saying.
Holy shit, triplets.
It's true, three's company.
- It shows tons of bush.
- Hey, hey, careful.
Careful with that. You're crinkling.
That's a collector's item.
It's worth a lot of money.
What's up, faggots?
What's up, man? What, you're not
gonna come down, say hi to me?
Hi, Derek.
Whoa, calm down, man.
I'm just joking.
You guys, I really like
your guys' setup up here.
What is your problem, man?
My problem? I don't know.
I don't have a problem, Dale.
Actually, I have the opposite
of a problem:
I made over 550 K last year.
How much did you make?
- It's not about money.
- No, it's not about money.
Well, for me,
it's a little bit about money...
...and I made
that much money last year.
I am the VP of the biggest...
...executive-helicopter-leasing
company on the Western Seaboard.
Okay? I haven't had a carb
since 2004.
Check these out. See these?
See these boys?
This is what I live with.
Every day I lather this up
with Kiehl's in the shower.
You wanna touch this shit?
You wanna touch these bad boys?
Sorry, not gonna happen.
Is there something you want?
I promised Mom I'd offer you a job.
I told her it'd count as her
Christmas present, so...
No. I'm never gonna work for you.
Fine. I don't care.
The truth is I just smoked a J
out in my car a few minutes ago...
...so feeling a little spacy.
Know what I'm say...?
What's up with you, man?
What you looking at, kemosabe?
You...
You wanna punch me right now.
You wanna punch me right now,
but you won't.
You wanna punch me too?
You guys both look like you might
wanna hit me in the face.
You do, I can tell.
Well, why don't you do it?
Why don't you punch me
in the face?
Punch me in the fucking face!
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my shoulder!
That was awesome.
Mom! Mom!
Derek, know what's always good
for shoulder pain?
- What?
- lf you lick my butthole.
Snap!
- Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Bobby.
- Sure.
Aside from that retard trying to punch
me, it was a pretty good evening.
- It was our pleasure, son.
- Why are you calling him that?
Oh, don't, don't.
Bye, kids. I'll check out that stock
you recommended, Tommy.
Excuse me.
- Hi. I'm Alice, I'm Derek's wife.
- Hi.
Is it true you struck Derek in the face
and he fell from the tree house?
Yeah. He asked me to.
Oh, that's the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.
I want you to know that tonight...
...I am gonna pleasure myself to
the image of you doing that to Derek.
You know what I mean?
Masturbate.
I am.
Oh, Dale.
You are something.
You are something.
You're something too.
I wanna roll you into a little ball
and shove you up my vagina.
You could just live there.
It's warm and it's cozy.
In your vagina?
I wanna walk around with you
in there and just know that...
...whenever I feel a little tickle
or scratch...
...that it's just your hair
up my vagina.
Please, just do it for me.
What's happening?
Kiss me.
I know. I know. It's too much.
It's too much.
I hate my life, Dale.
Dale, I hate my life!
I have nobody to talk to.
- Well, you seemed okay at the di...
- Please.
Alice! Honey, come on!
Dane Cook, pay-per-view,
Coming, honey!
I'm just talking to Dale.
This is so stupid.
Call me.
- I love you.
- Okay.
- Hey. What'd she want?
- What?
Nothing. Who's...? Who?
Alice.
We were just talking. Not...
It was not about sex or anything.
I can't believe you hit Derek.
I know. Did you see
the expression on his face?
- That was cool.
- Listen.
I know that we started out as foe.
But after that courageous act...
...that you showed me
against the one they call Derek...
...maybe someday
we could become friends.
Friends who ride majestic,
translucent steeds...
...shooting flaming arrows
across the Bridge of Hemdale.
I would follow you into the mists
of Avalon, if that's what you mean.
Do you wanna see something cool
that only three people have seen?
Okay, open your eyes.
See that black smudge
right there on the blade?
- Yeah.
- Look at it closely.
- Pretty recognizable signature.
- No.
Randy Jackson from American Idol.
Why do you have Randy Jackson's
autograph on a martial-arts weapon?
I bumped into him
and all I had was this sword...
...and you're not gonna not get
Randy Jackson's autograph.
I would've done
the exact same thing.
Now, do you wanna see
something really cool?
- Of course.
- Turn off the lights.
Industrial-strength
night-vision goggles.
Holy Santa Claus shit.
Can you imagine if we had these
when we were 12?
Even better.
We got them when we're 40.
You know what's amazing? They're
not that noticeable on your face.
- Right?
- Yeah.
I can't believe I've been living here
for two weeks...
...and I'm walking
around this place...
...thinking I've got a huge doucher
for a stepbrother.
Secretly, you're not a doucher.
Let's play a game, all right?
On the count of three,
name your favorite dinosaur.
Don't even think about it, just name it.
Ready? One, two, three.
- Velociraptor.
- Velociraptor.
Favorite non-pornographic magazine
to masturbate to.
- Good Housekeeping.
- Good Housekeeping.
If you were a chick, who's
the one guy you'd sleep with?
- John Stamos.
- John Stamos.
- What?
- Did we just become best friends?
Yep.
Do you wanna go do karate
in the garage?
Yup!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
I think they're starting to
like each other.
I got a really bad feeling about this.
- Sword fight!
- I know.
Sword fight!
- Exactly the same!
- I know! That's so weird.
Now you're in trouble.
- Come on!
- No!
They're betting against you,
but you can do it!
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Is this a bad time?
What the hell's going on?
Ma, Mr. Doback, okay,
Dale and I were just...
Please, stop calling me Mr. Doback.
Sorry. Okay.
Mom, Doback...
...we think it would be very prudent...
- Can we turn our beds into bunk beds?
- Yes.
Why are you guys so sweaty?
We've already figured out how.
The beds match up perfectly.
It would give us so much extra space
in our room to do activities.
Please say yes.
You don't need our permission
to build bunk beds.
You're adults.
You can do what you want.
So...?
I'm not making myself clear.
I don't give a fuck.
Now, you both have
several interviews tomorrow.
I would think you'd be focused
on that and not building bunk beds.
- So...?
- So...?
- We can? No?
- Yes. Yes, you can make bunk beds.
- I knew it.
- Okay. You are not gonna regret this.
We'll get so much more
activities done.
This is the funnest night ever!
This is so scary.
- How you doing over there?
- Really good.
Okay.
Does your son know anything
about carpentry?
No, not a th... Did I hear a drill?
- Dale! Dale, no power tools!
- Power tools.
- What?
- No power tools!
- No, I forgot, I have to brush my teeth.
- That is not your toothbrush.
Oh, okay. Well, I'm all done anyway.
- We did it.
- We did it!
It looks amazing!
Look at that! That looks like
what you'd buy from a store!
- Should've been a bunk bed all along.
- Look at this space.
- We could do aerobics in here.
- So many activities!
- Do step class.
- It's making my head spin...
...how many activities we can do.
- Play Army men.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Hey, I never asked you.
Do you like guacamole?
Oh, Brennan! Oh, God!
Brennan! Brennan!
Dad. Nancy. It's bad.
It's so bad.
There's blood everywhere.
The bunk beds were a terrible idea.
Why'd you let us do that?
It's so bad!
How would you describe that?
- It's not so bad.
- Right. See?
Put your beds back.
Rumpus time is over.
You got a big day tomorrow.
You need your eight hours.
And although she was 88 years old,
she never stopped believing.
And although she was 88 years old,
she never stopped believing.
It's 8:20 in the a.m.
Coming up next, a recent study
by the American Council...
Look at her. She's hot.
Okay, guys, this is it.
Good luck. Don't be late.
Dad, I need to borrow
some clothes for the interview...
...since I don't have
any fancy clothes.
You go in my closet, take whatever
you need. You guys gotta look sharp.
This is the most important
day of our lives.
- Okay.
- No pressure, no pressure.
- All right? Relax.
- Okay.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
This is your day.
Remember that. You own it.
- This is your one day!
- All right.
Mr. Huff, Mr. Jeener
is ready for your interview.
Actually, we'll be
interviewing as a team.
We're here to fuck shit up.
Move it!
Hey!
Well, Brennan, you certainly
have had a lot of jobs.
I'm a bit of a spark plug.
And, Human Resources lady,
when I think...
- You know, it's... Actually, it's Pam.
- I'm sorry.
- Well, Pan...
- No, my name is Pam.
- Are you saying Pan or Pam?
- I'm saying Pam.
Yeah, I'm sorry, who is this
gentleman sitting behind you?
Hello, Ms. Lady. I'm Dale.
I'm Brennan's stepbrother...
...and I think I might be able to help
with the Pan-Pam dilemma.
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Pam.
- Pan.
- Pam.
- Pand. There's a D on the end.
- With an M.
- There's no D. It's Pam.
- It's like "comb," except P-A-N-M.
- N-N. There's two N's.
- Two M's. That was the confusion.
No, there's just one M.
What do you say we interview you?
All right. Yes, that's a
sometimes-useful exercise.
Please put your hand down.
Go ahead.
How much money do you make
a year before taxes?
Okay, I'm actually not comfortable
answering that.
- Come on!
- We're doing the interview, not you.
Here's a shot out of a cannon:
Oprah, Barbara Walters, your wife.
You gotta fuck one,
marry one, kill one. Go!
I think we're done here. Thank you.
Mr. Huff, under your references,
you listed Dale Doback...
...which I know is this gentleman,
but you also listed...
..."Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior."
- Yeah.
Yeah, we are looking for people
we can contact.
We wanna tell you the stuff
we're not good at.
- Our weaknesses.
- So we're clear up front.
- Okay.
- We're not generally comfortable...
...in an office setting, I would say.
- I get cooped up.
I won't go into an office
that's ever been used before.
I am no good before 11 a.m.
I also get headaches from computers,
so I can't be around them too long.
I take stuff.
I need someone to go up and down
with me in the elevator.
I have a weakness for sweets.
Other weaknesses?
We're slow learners and we're
not particularly good listeners.
- That'll be a huge problem.
- We're also slow learners.
First of all,
I needed someone to work...
Wait, shut your mouth.
Shut your mouth.
I think we've had enough...
- Shush up for one second.
- Shut your mouth.
- Wait, shut your mouth.
- I'm sorry, what did you just say?
- You're just coming off stupid.
- I'm coming off stupid?
You're wearing tuxedos to a job that
requires you to clean bathrooms.
- Please leave this office, we're done.
- Do we get any sort of souvenir?
Get out of my office!
I'm looking to hire guys I don't mind
hanging out with for 12 hours a day.
You guys seem like cool guys.
Got hair similar to mine,
you wear tuxedos to the interview.
That's funny, it's ironic. I get that.
Underplaying the whole formality of it.
I think that's funny as hell.
So let's do this, you know?
You guys are hired. You're in.
Unless you're the weirdest guys ever
and I don't see it.
Great.
- Was that a fart?
- I don't know.
I can taste it.
On my tongue.
Okay, I'll be honest with you.
I did fart.
Is that onion? Onion and...
Onion and ketchup.
- It stinks. And this is a small room.
- Shit.
Okay, now the tuxedos
seem kind of fucked up.
God. We were so close.
So, what do we do for jobs?
Is your dad really gonna kick us out?
Listen, don't worry about my dad.
Got him sewn up.
We've gotta start thinking bigger,
though, Brennan.
Listen, what are you really good at?
Singing. I'm a world-class singer.
See? Right there,
that's an amazing skill.
Now, what am I good at?
I can shred on the drums
and I'm a marketing wiz.
Put all that together,
what do you get?
- I don't know, a band?
- No, that's been done before.
Even better: we are gonna start an
The biggest and the best.
And we're gonna call it
Prestige Worldwide.
That sounds so cool.
I feel like a lightning bolt
hit the tip of my penis.
Yeah. Yeah.
We're brothers. This is why we met.
- To form this alliance, right?
- Right?
That's why our parents met,
so this idea could happen.
- Okay, what do we do?
- We get to work.
And we hit the beat laboratory
right now. Let's go.
- What?
- Wait.
What time is it?
- 4:30.
- 4:30.
- I can't go down Whitworth right now.
- Okay.
We should go this way.
- What's up?
- Chris Gardocki.
- What?
- He gets in my face...
...and I just don't wanna
deal with the hassle now.
- Are you this scared?
- Can we please go the long way?
- Down Cutler?
- Yeah.
But that's 45 minutes.
You're gonna shame me
into doing this.
- You sound stupid.
- You'll be sorry. Okay, I'm stupid.
Oh, man.
Oh, God, there they are.
Oh, my God, is that Dale Doback?
- Let's make him lick dog shit.
- Yeah.
Hey, fag-stick. Long time, no see.
Is that your boyfriend?
Is that your butt buddy?
Look, Mr. Gardocki,
just leave me alone, will you?
Shut your mouth, es.
You guys just go back and have fun
on your jungle gym, okay?
Does butt buddy have a name?
If you're referring to me as
butt buddy, yes, I do have a name.
It's Brennan Huff.
If you don't come over here
and lick that white dog shit...
...l'm gonna plow into your nose
with my fist.
- I'm not licking any white dog shit.
- I'll lick the shit if you leave us alone.
Dale, you're not licking
dog shit, okay? They're kids.
- Brennan, it's just dog shit.
- It's ridiculous!
- Hello, how are...?
- Oh, God!
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!
Get them!
So maybe you don't
go down that way anymore.
Maybe you go the long way home.
That's what we talked about.
We'll take the long way home.
You know in that one scene
in The Wizard of Oz...
...when the flying monkeys
pull apart the Scarecrow?
That's what it was like.
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry.
Is my dad mad about
the stuff that happened?
Robert was very upset, yes.
He knows that you interviewed
as a team.
And he heard about the fart.
- Oh, he did?
- Yeah.
You just couldn't hold it, or you...?
- No. I thought it was gonna be silent.
- It was not silent.
Just kept going, and it made a sound.
It was embarrassing.
It got louder.
So listen, Bobby,
I'll get those keys made tomorrow...
...and then we'll start setting up times.
- Thank you.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.
- Always nice to see you.
- You too.
Hey, guys.
Looks like your
free ride's over, huh?
Have fun living on the streets.
Okay, cool. Good chatting, you guys.
Bye, Mom.
- Bye.
- See you, buddy.
What was he doing here?
We're putting the house
on the market.
- Where are we moving?
- Is the house haunted?
Nancy and I are retiring...
...and sailing around the world
on my boat.
We are living the dream.
Well, what about us?
I'm sorry. Robert... We thought that...
...you should take responsibility
for your own lives.
This is the exciting part:
We're going to put enough
money in your accounts...
...for a security deposit
on an apartment.
What's this all about?
More than just money, we're gonna get
you another kind of support as well.
You're both gonna see therapists.
Nancy thinks it'll help.
- Guys, that's nonnegotiable.
- Hold on. We're not going on the boat...
...Derek's selling the house,
we have to go to therapy?
- What the fuck happened?
- Hey!
Look, I know this seems
really, really sudden...
...and just sort of unfair
and cruel and...
- But it's nonnegotiable.
- But it's nonnegotiable.
I got a bellyful
of white dog crap in me...
...and now you lay this shit on me?
You're adults. It's time
you started acting like adults.
- Mom.
- I'm not backing down, Brennan.
Don't even try.
I know it seems hard,
but it's the best thing for both of you.
We do it because we love you.
Dad, I'm doing this because
I love you: fuck you.
- Anything else?
- No.
Bon voyage! Have a great time!
Hey, what's up, Derek?
Yeah.
- Know what?
- Look what I got.
I'm sitting here thinking we finally got
a family together here...
...and now it's about to be taken away
because they think we're losers.
- Because they don't understand us?
- Yeah.
They don't get that this lifestyle
is a choice.
And all they think about
is that stupid boat.
I swear, I'm so pissed off
at my mom.
As soon as she is of age,
I'm putting her in a home.
We have got to get
Prestige Worldwide going.
It's the thing that's
gonna save this family.
I was thinking we should
have a investor presentation...
...like on The Apprentice.
We gotta start
with some capital somewhere.
Here's the thing, though:
If we're gonna start
a huge multinational corporation...
...I have to hear you sing.
Can't you just trust that
I'm a really, really good singer?
Just one song, so I know
what your voice sounds like.
Yeah, yeah. I'll just do it.
No big deal. I'll just dive into it
and just start singing.
Jesus, my heart is beating
so fast right now.
Okay, just do it. Just do it.
Just...
You know, I don't know.
I didn't sing too loud, because I don't
wanna wake up Robert and Nancy.
My throat's sore. I've had
a sore throat for a month and a half.
And this is not an acoustic
environment that's suitable...
...to request this from me.
You gotta know,
I'm not just some guy.
Brennan, that is
the voice of an angel.
Brennan, I can't even make
eye contact with you right now.
Your voice is like a combination
of Fergie and Jesus.
Why can't you do that
in front of people?
Are you messing with me right now?
It's me, Dale.
You're good.
- I know.
- This is gonna sound weird...
...but for a second, I think
you took on the shape of a unicorn.
I felt like I was hovering
above my own body...
...watching myself sing.
Now, let's move on
to other business.
First thing tomorrow, we gotta get
cracking on this investor presentation.
And guess what else.
This just came to me.
- We're making a music video.
- Yeah!
What do we do about Derek
and the house?
Don't worry about him.
Oh, it's a great "nabe."
Frank Gifford
used to live down the block.
- The Giff?
- Yeah, the Giff. Right down the block.
I'm getting
a really good feeling about this.
I am so glad.
You get us that 10-year
interest-only loan, we got a deal.
Hey, fuckers!
Welcome to the neighborhood!
- My name is Craig.
- The neighbor is a Nazi?
You guys ever need fertilizer,
I've got a lot of it. Close to 80 tons.
Hey, folks! How you doing?
You're gonna love this neighborhood.
Every single house here recycles.
- Okay, we're done here.
- Yeah, okay.
Hey, Derek, sprechen sie dick.
Dale, I don't know how much
you know about therapy...
...but it usually starts by you
telling me something about yourself.
I work at a college as a janitor...
...even though I'm smarter
than most of the people there.
Sometimes I see an equation
written on a blackboard...
...like half an equation,
and I'll just figure it out.
- Is this Good Will Hunting?
- No.
It sounds a lot like the plot
of Good Will Hunting.
Yeah. Anyway.
My best friend is Ben Affleck...
So I thought we'd begin
talking about your parents' divorce.
Okay.
How old were you
when they got divorced?
- Fifteen.
- That's a hard age.
- Yes. Yeah.
- Do you wanna talk...
...about some of those feelings?
- I love you.
- Obviously, you don't know me.
- I love you so much.
Thank you. And I will take that
as a feeling that you have...
...of comfortability with me.
It's more than comfortability.
- I mean, I fucking love you.
- Okay. I th...
I'm just thinking
about our life together.
I feel like I'm walking on a cloud.
My penis is tingling right now.
- That is so off-putting.
- You're not feeling this?
In no way, shape or form do I feel
any feelings of intimacy towards you...
...in any way whatsoever.
You got a really dope
front lawn here.
You and your homeboys
can play on that.
- You can just say "It looks good."
- Yeah.
No, that's how I talk.
Oh, you got a really fresh
entryway here. Pretty awesome.
- show you the front of the house,
which is actual...
Will you vultures please give us some
privacy? He just died last night.
What is going on here?
It was the asbestos in here,
that's what did it!
I've seen too many dead bodies.
- I can't be in here. I can't.
- No, no, no.
- Not bad.
- Eat shit, Derek.
- Awesome B-day party, broheisens.
- You the man, Derek.
Okay, who's this from? TJ?
Where are
the rest of my gifts, dude?
Totally joking around, TJ.
All right.
Oh, yes! Yes! Callaway 3-wood.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Yeah.
- Bomb it down the fairway, bitches!
- That's right.
Hi, my name is Jim.
Wanna suck my dick for money?
- It's just me. Hi.
- Oh, my God.
What are you doing?
This is the men's bathroom.
Happy anniversary.
- It's our second date.
- What?
Listen, I'm sick of being
all coy and bashful, Dale. Okay?
- We're in the bathroom.
- This'll just take a minute.
There's really little you can
do about it. Let me just hop on.
It's all slippery.
Oh, my God!
It's getting tingly.
Something's gonna happen, Alice!
Oh, we just had sex.
- Just the way I imagined it.
- I like you.
I love you.
- Stay golden, Ponyboy. I gotta pee.
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
You're incredible.
Say hello to my little friend.
- Just kidding. It's from Scarface.
- Scarface.
Shut the fuck up!
- Sweet-ass gift, Teej.
- Yeah, not bad.
- I got it all mapped out.
- Okay.
- I'm following your lead, though.
- I'll get all eyes on us.
- Okay.
- Just like we planned.
And then we'll drop the hammer.
What were Dale and Brennan doing
with my video camera, do you know?
I have no idea. And frankly,
I really don't care. So...
I would like to say a few things.
Derek, you are an outstanding
young man, son.
And I would like say that
this is the image I have:
That sometimes when I'm making love
to your mother and I realize that...
...this is where you came from,
that I'm so moved...
...that I talked to my lawyer,
and not only are you going to be...
...in my heart forever, but you're
going to be in my will, young man.
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?
- Robert, that was fucking awesome.
- Thank you.
You got a lot of this, buddy.
And you got a lot of these.
Thank you.
Everyone, if I could have
your attention, please.
For those of you
who don't know me...
...my name's Dale Doback.
- Check. Check.
I'm Robert's other son,
the biological one.
Check. Check.
Probably wondering
why we gathered you here tonight...
...besides Derek's birthday.
We got a special surprise for you,
Derek, and everybody here...
- Check, check.
- Check.
- Dale. No, please.
- Don't interrupt them.
- I'm begging you.
- You wanna shut this down?
- Just hold on.
- Derek, for your birthday...
...we thought we'd roll out...
...a once-in-a-lifetime
business opportunity.
Happy birthday, Derek.
Music.
Prestige Worldwide,
wide, wide, wide.
Prestige Worldwide.
- The first word in entertainment.
- First word.
- Management.
- Financial portfolios.
- Insurance.
- Computers.
- Black leather gloves.
- Research and development.
Putting in the man-hours to study
the science of what you need.
Last week we put Liquid Paper
on a bee...
...and it died.
- Security.
- Security.
- And...
- And.
- Possibly you.
- Possibly you.
- Oh, this is classic. This is...
- We'd like to present...
...the world premiere of Prestige
Worldwide's first music video...
...by our first act, Huff and Doback.
- Roll it.
- Roll it.
Pay close attention, Dad.
It's gonna look familiar.
- This is... This is perfect.
- Is that my boat?
Yes, it is.
What are you doing on my boat?
The Nia, the Pinta
The Santa Mara
I'll do you in the bottom
While you're drinking sangria
Nachos and Lemonheads
On my dad's boat
You won't go down
'Cause my dick can float
We sail around the world
And go port to port
Every time I come
I produce a quart
That is offensive. Brennan, Dale.
I gotta have me my boats and ho's
Deadliest Catch without the crabs
We're almost out of gas
Call the Arabs
Pull up the anchor
'Cause we're leaving dry land
Get below deck
With a dick in your hand
Boats and ho's
Boats and ho's
I gotta have me my boats and ho's
Are you ready for some
world-class vocalization?
- Get a partner.
- Wait a minute.
- Who's steering the boat?
- Dad, please shut up.
Please shut up!
Yeah!
So...
...big question is:
Aside from the damage to the boat,
which we will fix...
...what'd you think
of the presentation?
Brennan, I think that what you did
to Robert's boat was horrid.
Having said that,
I think that both of you boys...
...showed a lot of enthusiasm
and inventiveness.
Yes. Thank you.
You gotta be kidding me.
They destroyed our dream
and you're calling it inventive.
- No, no, no. I didn't mean it like that.
- Yes, you did.
Come on, you did.
It's gonna be four years, at least,
before we can sail anywhere.
- And you could care less, admit it.
- I will not admit that...
...because it is not true.
- Oh, yeah.
But, you know,
I do think that you could show...
...a little bit more attentiveness
to your son and your stepson...
...who obviously need you.
It's true, Dr. Doback.
You've been very cold
and unsupportive of our dreams.
You wrecked my fucking boat,
you goon!
Don't speak to my son like that.
Your son's costing me $80,000.
We could bicker about this all night,
but what's done is done, Dad.
- Are you guys gonna invest or not?
- That's it! That's it!
- What are you doing?
- Grab the wheel!
I can't believe
you're being so stingy.
- Robert, come down.
- It's a simple business decision.
You jackaloons!
You're failures! Failures!
And you're embarrassing yourself,
you geriatric fuck!
- Brennan.
- Two things:
You keep your liver-spotted hands
off my beautiful mother.
She's a saint!
Then you sit down and you write Dale
and Brennan a check for $ 10,000.
Oh, stop it.
Or I'm gonna shove one of those fake
hearing devices so far up your ass...
- Brennan!
...you can hear the sound...
...of your small intestine
as it produces shit!
- All right, here we go.
- Oh, my Lord.
Somebody should've done this
a long time ago, and I'm gonna do it.
- What are you doing?
- Robert.
There are consequences
for your actions.
- No! Robert!
- Dad!
- This is not the answer.
- You're next, mister.
- You understand me?
- Yes.
- Certain behaviors...
- Let go of me.
...will not be tolerated!
- My ass is on fire!
Wow, the tree looks great, Nancy.
Really tasteful.
Thank you, Dale. That's a very nice
sweater you're wearing.
It was my mom's.
I took the shoulder pads out.
Oh, and, Brennan? Denise called...
...and she said she can't go out
with you on New Year's Eve...
...because she's not your girlfriend,
she's your therapist.
- Is that what she said?
- Yeah.
She's a rascal.
Hey, Dad, Nancy?
Would it be cool if Brennan and I
opened just one present each...
...since it's Christmas Eve?
I'm gonna go down to the
Cheesecake Factory, have a drink.
But it's Christmas Eve.
Merry Christmas.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
I had my eye on one.
I hope it's what I think it is.
Oh, my God. Hulk Hands!
Wait, Dale got Hulk Hands?
Well, you reek of Scotch
and cheesecake.
You know...
...tonight at the Cheesecake Factory
was the happiest I've been in months.
- Well, then I feel very sorry for you.
- Well, just...
Nancy, I don't know if I can ever
forgive them for wrecking my boat.
- Why are you giving up?
- I'm not giving up. I'm not.
- You are. You're giving up on our boys.
- But they're 40.
I don't care how old they are.
They're still our children.
Well, sometime it's got to matter
how old they are.
That's all we do, is...
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Oh, it...
You know, they'll go back to bed.
See? They're sleepwalking.
No. No.
See, back to bed.
They'll be fine.
Just nonsense.
I'm gonna wake them up.
- No. Why would you do such a thing?
- Well, because it's...
- Never, ever wake up a sleepwalker.
- See, that's it.
- We can't ever do anything.
- No.
But they could do real harm
to themselves or others.
- Oh, the Christmas presents.
- No, guys... No, no, don't...
- No. But...
- I think we should take control.
- It's always about them.
- How do you propose to do that?
- Oh, Jesus.
- Whatever you do, don't wake them.
They might do real harm
to themselves or others.
- Not everybody does know that.
- Oh, the Christmas tree!
Oh, not the... No, don't...
All right, that's it!
- I'm waking them up!
- No! No!
- Don't wake them up!
- That's a myth!
- Wake up, both of you.
- Don't.
I told you! I told you!
Stop it! Don't hurt him!
The pictures! Nancy!
Robert!
I mean, I was driving around
with a buddy of mine, Topher.
You guys remember Topher, right?
Driving around, he has this
brand-new Testarossa, right?
We hit this four-point buck. Dead.
Lying in the road.
Long story short,
we sue the state of Michigan.
I end up getting 125 G's. Okay?
You know what I spent that money on?
Sniper rifle to hunt deer.
Either way, the deers lose,
my friends.
Good riddance.
Eat all the damn flowers, anyway.
If you'll excuse me...
...I think I'm going to go into
the other room to check my hair.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, everybody.
If you'll excuse
my space-cadet wife here.
Let's just say the meds
aren't helping.
I'm kidding. Kidding. But not at all.
I have to get some more gravy.
- Oh, Dale, it's right there.
- Oh, no.
Shush up, Nancy.
I have to get some more bread.
What did I do to deserve that?
What do any of us do
to deserve anything?
I pay enough taxes to support
all these lazy goddamn liberals.
Get off me! Off!
Get back. Get back! Back!
- What do you want?
- Merry Christmas, darling.
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, that was torture.
I couldn't eat another bite of turkey
without thinking of you inside of me.
Come on, let's try something illegal.
So, Tommy, what did you
get for Christmas?
Well, Santa brought me the Bowflex
and $ 1000 in fresh-minted $50 bills.
Wanna know what I got
for Christmas? A crushed soul.
- Alice, please.
- Sing along, Santa.
You know this song.
What is that noise?
It's... This is the ghost.
- Just try to be quiet. Okay.
- You're right. You're right.
- We've got to be discreet.
- All right.
No, no! Oh, hey.
Are you all still talking in here?
What are you doing?
Alice was moving a chair from the
living room into the dining room...
...for an extra chair
and her back went out.
And I just did the best thing,
which is get right on the muscles...
- Muscles.
...so they don't seize up.
Just add some heat to it.
Damn it, Dale, sit down.
It's just a real deep, tight muscle.
Hey, sweetie,
can you grab me a beer?
- I'll get you another Heineken.
- Yeah.
Merry Christmas.
And how about you, Tiffany,
what did you get for Christmas?
I got this Mikimoto pearl necklace.
But next year I'm gonna ask
Santa for breast implants...
...because I'm impatient
with my body.
Hey, Tiffany. Wanna know
what I got? A crushed soul.
You mentioned that earlier.
- So good.
- Oh, gosh!
It's gone into a real bad spasm,
so I put a yoga move on her.
- grant me this one,
because I was pretty wasted.
So I put my lips
around that breathalyzer...
...and I saw those numerals pop up:
So I started going to Chad
Michael Murray's Christmas party.
I think that was the year.
And just driving...
I have to interrupt you. Robert, while
the children are in the living room...
...I think this would be a good time
to make our announcement.
- What's going on?
- It's over.
I'm gonna be moving in
with my friend Jack Handle...
...and Nancy found a townhouse
in the city.
What is this? What's happening?
What Robert is trying to say
is that we are getting a divorce.
- Don't do this.
- No. No!
- I could've called this one.
- No.
- Yeah.
- Is it our fault?
- Is it because we were bad?
- No. No.
The main thing that
Robert and I talked about...
...is that we did not want you two
to blame yourselves.
- What can we do to fix it?
- Dale, honey, are you okay?
- Why are you calling him "honey"?
- I cannot stress this enough:
- It is not your fault.
- Whose fault is it?
- Fuck it, I wanna fucking know!
- Let's cut the shit.
- It is directly your fault.
- Robert.
You destroyed my boat.
You beat me up in your sleep...
...and worst of all, you made
Nancy and I resent each other.
- It is absolutely 150 percent your fault!
- Of course it's their fault.
They're the world's biggest dickheads,
and they're living in your house.
- Shut up, Derek.
- I'm sorry, but that...
Please don't cry like that.
Please don't, Brennan.
- Mommy!
- Dale!
I told you that they would feel
completely to blame.
- Oh, let's grow up.
- I think I'm going to throw up.
- I think I'm gonna throw up...
- Don't throw up.
...all the nice dinner that I had.
I'm gonna throw it up.
- You're not gonna throw up.
- He's gonna throw up.
- Come on.
- My God, he threw up. Oh, this is ugly.
- Hey, guys. Guys.
- This is not nice!
- All right, dipshits. Right here.
- Stop it, Derek.
- One, two, three...
- I don't want my picture taken now.
Good luck, and remember, I need you
out of this house by tomorrow.
No exceptions.
If there's anything you need,
anything that you boys need...
...you just give me a call. Okay?
It's all right.
Hey. Are you awake?
Yeah.
I can't believe we actually
have to move out of this house.
I know. I feel bad.
Hey, you know,
we don't have to whisper anymore.
Mom and Dad aren't here.
Yeah, but can we keep
doing it, though?
It helps me pretend that they are.
You must feel just terrible.
- I mean, I know I feel bad.
- Yeah.
But I can't imagine how you feel...
...after my dad looked
right at you and said...
...it's all your fault
that they broke up.
That's funny, because my mom said:
"If that curly-headed fuck Dale
wasn't here...
...everything would be perfect."
- You take that back.
- No way. It's your fault.
You know what your problem is?
You live in a fantasy land.
You refuse to get a job...
...and you don't know what it's like
to work for something.
You don't take responsibility for
your actions. This is all your fault!
Well, you're a mama's boy
who's too chicken to sing in public!
Yeah, that's right.
Run away, little boy,
because you know it's true.
Just avoid everything.
What are you doing?
- Dale broke up Mom and Dad
- Motherfucker!
Dale broke up Mom and Dad
Dale broke up Mom and Dad
- Dale broke up Mom and...
- Brennan!
Get up, Brennan,
I know you're faking. Get up!
Get up!
Brennan?
It's just like Cold Case Files.
It's just like Cold Case Files.
It's just like Cold Case Files.
People die every day.
Give him a proper burial
in an unmarked grave...
- Brennan! You're alive! Oh, my God.
- I know.
I'm alive.
- You were dead. I saw you die!
- I was faking.
I used ninja focus
to slow my heart rate down.
- What are you doing?
- I'm burying you.
- I'm alive. Brennan, I'm alive.
- You're waking the neighbors!
- Shut up!
- No. No.
- Now I'm gonna play your drum set.
- Help me.
Close your eyes.
Let the dirt just shower over you.
This is your fault.
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna sleep good tonight.
- Don't you touch my drums!
- Zombie!
Zombie! Zombie!
Get off me, zombie.
Get off.
I'm late for school.
I will kiss you right on the mouth,
Kenny Rogers.
- Just get off me.
- Hey.
So I guess it's really over.
I'd say you trying to bury me alive
pretty much did it.
You know what I just realized?
You've been the one
dragging me down.
Now I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna
get a job and an apartment...
...and then I'm gonna get Mom
and Dr. Doback back together.
I'm gonna be the hero,
and you can suck on it.
My life was perfect
before you came here.
Me and my dad had a perfect setup,
and you wrecked it.
Hey.
We're no longer brothers.
We never were.
We were stepbrothers.
- That was one of your best.
- These balls fucking suck.
All right.
Well, well, well,
look who's here, boys.
Can you give me a job, please?
TJ, get an office pool going.
Give Ken-Doll Crotch here
two weeks, tops.
Dr. Angel Face,
I just wanted to say thank you...
...for meeting me
on such short notice.
- Don't call me Angel Face.
- I apologize.
I'm very alone right now, and the thing
I wanna ask you to help me...
To show me how I can be
a grown-up.
Do I carry my
high-school diploma around?
What do you do with your hair?
What happens if there's
inclement weather?
Where do you...?
What do you wear?
Can you wash clothes
in the dishwasher?
I notice that there's a long gap
in your job history...
...and it said for 22 years...
...you went Kerouac
on everyone's ass?
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I really need a job.
And I will take any position,
as long as it doesn't involve...
...having sex with old ladies
for money or bear traps.
- Those are my two bugaboos.
- All right, got it.
There's a catering business,
there's a temp job open.
And you get to play with fire.
What do you want?
This is my online-poker time.
I'm ready to take on
the Catalina Wine Mixer.
Slow down there, Speed Racer.
I know what it entails,
and I'm ready to nail it.
I want it, okay?
I want the Catalina Wine Mixer.
- Yo, yo.
- Hey, D-man.
- You tell him what's up?
- I sure did.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Your brother wants a shot
at the Catalina Wine Mixer.
I'm ready, walking tall.
You're ready to run with the bulls?
I've been earning and burning,
snapping necks and cashing checks.
Screw it, let's let him do it.
It's a win-win for me...
...because if you fuck up, Brennan...
- Yeah?
...I get to fire your ass. But if you pull
it off, I look like a genius to the board.
- Okay?
- I get it.
Brennan, here's the thing.
It's the Catalina fucking
Wine Mixer, okay?
Are you saying "pow"?
What are you saying?
It's the biggest helicopter-leasing
event in the Western Hemisphere...
...since 1997.
- Why does he keep doing that?
- I have to sell or lease...
...at least 80 choppers
to make my nut.
And you mess with my nut, Brennan,
Randy here is gonna eat your dick.
Like Kobayashi.
I've seen him do it.
You've seen him eat a penis?
It was in international waters,
so they couldn't prosecute him.
I tell you now, I'll nail it.
I'll pull it off, okay?
Wait a second,
why do you want this so bad?
Trying to get Mom and Dad
back together or something?
- Why do I want this?
- Yeah.
Because I wanna make bank, bro.
I wanna get ass.
And I wanna drive a Range Rover.
Okay, well, you better, Brennan.
This is the fucking
Catalina Wine Mixer.
Nancy. Hi.
Hi. What are you doing here?
Well, Dale's working the function.
Guys, this is supposed to be jicama,
not bok choy.
Sorry, folks.
And I got an invitation from Brennan.
Can you believe
Brennan put all this together?
And now here we all are in Catalina.
- It's funny, huh?
- Yeah, it's funny.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.
Not bad. You're nailing it.
- Thanks, Randy. That means a lot.
- Yeah.
I don't know what it is...
...but I wanna deliver one of these
right in your suck hole.
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. Not really. It's your face.
Again, you're doing great, man.
The Catalina Wine Mixer.
We're all having a great time,
having fun.
You pulled it off.
But if you don't change your face...
...l'm gonna change it for you.
- Okay. Okay.
All I can do is take that in,
consider it...
...and I'll just do my best version
of whatever I think that would be.
I don't even hear you,
your face is driving me nuts.
- Thanks again, though.
- Oh, tits. Hold on.
- Hey. Hello, Catalina Wine Mixer.
- Hi.
How are you? We are Uptown Girl.
We are California's preeminent
"Piano Man"!
What did I just say, man?
All right, we don't play that...
...so let's keep it in the '80s
and let's keep it fun.
You having a good time?
I hope you are,
because sometimes life can be tough.
And I know that sometimes
it's hard to "Keeping the Faith."
You guys seem to be hitting it off.
Oh, honey.
Oh, my God,
this is the greatest party.
- Hello, Robert.
- Way to go.
- Brennan, this is fantastic.
- Way to go.
So impressed.
- Hi, Dad. Hi, Nancy.
- Hi, Dale.
- Hey, Brennan.
- It's good to see you.
Thanks for hiring
our catering company.
Easy decision. You guys have
a outstanding track record.
- Just like old times, huh?
- Right, it really is.
You still have your
night-vision goggles?
No, no. No, I had to sell those
to pay for car insurance.
How about you?
You still breaking boards...
...or kicking holes in pumpkins
or anything?
No.
But I did start taking baby aspirin
to reduce my risk for heart attack.
That makes sense.
Gotta keep an eye on it, you know.
- Knock off the sweets.
- Thank you.
It's a truly funny observation.
Yeah.
Dale, the empanadas
are starting to sweat.
Okay. I better run.
- It's good to see you, Brennan.
- You too.
- Take care, be well. Take care, Dad.
- Okay, buddy.
- It's great to talk to him.
- Yeah.
I gotta go too.
We should do this again.
I think it was very constructive.
- Maybe grab a bite to eat?
- Sure.
- Go to Outback Steakhouse.
- Okay.
I've grown very fond of that place.
Thank you for coming.
Great to see you.
It was very nice to see you, Robert.
I think Brennan organized this
whole thing to get us back together.
You have to excuse me.
I think that I just might cry.
It's the funniest thing. Bye-bye.
"Start the Fire," buddy!
Come on, man. Play something
from The Stranger!
We strictly do '80s Joel music, sir.
'80s Billy Joel doo-wop sucks!
Hey, listen, motherfucker,
we only sing '80s Joel!
So take your skank hooker wife
and get the fuck out of here!
Shit.
- What's wrong?
- All right. "What's wrong?"
Get him out of here.
Get his ass out of here!
Hey.
Hey, great job, fuck face. You just
busted my nut. This party's shot.
Just relax. I didn't realize
he would say these things.
You know what?
You cost me money.
So this isn't even
a judgment call, man.
- You're Audi 5000, my friend.
- Derek, can't we talk about this?
No.
- Hey.
- Shit.
- Is everything okay?
- No. He just fired me.
What happened to the music?
The band left. The guy freaked out.
Derek fired me.
- It's no big deal.
- Robert, you don't get it.
It's the Catalina Wine Mixer!
People have killed
to be in the position I'm in.
- He's right. It's a big deal.
- Here's a thought:
I see an empty stage.
I see drums, I see a drummer.
I see a microphone,
and I see a singer.
- Dad, come on.
- What?
- We gave that stuff up.
- We don't do that.
Listen to me.
Dale, look, when I was a kid...
...when I was a little boy,
I always wanted to be a dinosaur.
I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex
more than anything.
I made my arms short
and I roamed the backyard...
...and I chased the neighborhood cats,
and I growled and I roared.
Everybody knew me
and was afraid of me.
And then one day, my dad said:
"Bobby, you're 17. It's time
to throw childish things aside."
And I said, "Okay, Pop."
But he didn't really say that, he said,
"Stop being a dinosaur and get a job."
But, you know, I thought to myself,
"I'll go to medical school...
...l'll practice for a little while,
and then I'll come back to it."
- Dad...
- How is that a skill?
But I forgot how to do it.
You're human.
- You could never be a dinosaur.
- Yeah.
Hey, I lost it.
- Dad, what's the point?
- Yeah.
The point is
don't lose your dinosaur.
Yeah. You know, I hated
the way you guys were before.
I mean, I hated you.
But it just kills me to see you
so crushed and normal.
Listen to me, don't listen to me...
...Prestige Worldwide,
that's what you gotta do.
- You're saying we should go for it.
- That's what I'm saying.
What do you think, Brennan?
I'm so scared right now.
I'm gonna do what's sensible:
I'm gonna file for unemployment...
...and I'm gonna try to get a job
at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.
Because they got
a excellent corporate structure...
...and they give you the tools
to be your own boss.
My dad's right.
This isn't me.
I'm fucking miserable.
I had to get up at 10:00 this morning.
And even though
I just got a tidal wave of nerves...
...l'm going up on that stage...
...and I'm gonna make beautiful music
for a sad world.
- Dale...
- That's the boy I know.
This crowd's gonna eat him alive.
Wait, what's he doing up there?
Somebody get him
off the fucking stage!
Hi. How you doing?
My name's Dale Doback,
and I hope you like to kick it.
Oh, go get them, Dale!
Boats and ho's
Get off the stage, you dick!
Stop yelling at him.
- Terrible!
- Terrible.
He's a human being.
Dale has a mangina
Dale has a mangina
No.
Gotta have me my boats and ho's
He's up there alone, Brennan.
He's up there alone.
Gotta have me my boats and ho's
- You suck!
- What are you doing, Brennan?
Gotta have me my...
Brennan, no!
- What did you do?
- Oh, Jesus, Nancy.
I couldn't stand to see him like that.
I miss my son.
All right. Let me go for a few bars.
Come in soft, but then finish strong.
- Okay. Hey, Brennan?
- Yeah.
- Thanks for coming up.
- You got it, Dragon.
We got a little change coming up.
It's my main man Brennan.
Boats and ho's
Boats and ho's
- You did it, Derek.
- I made a kite fly.
Brennan, you're the best
big brother ever!
- floor mats. The ones that match
the seats, and I kind of wanted...
I traveled 500 miles
to give you my seed.
Lumberjack!
Rock the fuck
out of those drums, Dale!
I'm sorry.
- We're Prestige Worldwide!
- Prestige Worldwide!
- Fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
- It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
It's the fucking Catalina Wine Mixer.
Brennan, that was sublime.
Amazing.
We are so proud of you both.
- Thank you.
- Incredible.
- Thank you so much.
- Hey.
So I made my quota.
Yeah, we sold a shit-ton of copters.
- That's so good.
- Yeah.
Look, I'm not great at
this Hallmark stuff...
...but, Brennan,
when I look at you now...
...I don't wanna kick you
in the head quite as much.
Thanks, man.
- That was beautiful.
- That was nice.
Yeah.
- What do we do now?
- We could hug.
Yeah, you'd like that, faggot.
Sorry. I'm...
Okay.
- It's okay.
- Okay.
- That's what we've been looking for.
- That's the ticket.
It's fantastic.
We've never done anything like that,
so you can't expect it to be perfect.
It was good.
- Felt good.
- Gotten close to a hug.
- Hello, Brennan. Hi.
- Denise. Hey.
Robert, Mom, Derek,
this is my girlfriend, Denise.
- Hi. How are you?
- Actually, I'm his therapist.
- We are in absolutely no way dating.
- Right.
Brennan told me he was going to
hurl his body off a helicopter...
...into shark-infested waters...
...so I had a legal obligation
to be here.
I get it.
Don't wanna appear too eager,
and that is a good strategy too.
You are an enabler.
You think you're helping...
...but you're not.
- And you are a keeper.
What'd you think?
Brennan, I thought
you were incredibly brave.
And I mean that...
...in strictly the most clinical
and professional sense possible...
...with no emotional,
intimate, sexual...
...or any other undertones
that you could possibly infer.
God, you're gonna make me cry.
What poem is that from?
Is that James Joyce?
Alice...
...I like making sex with you.
- Yeah.
I do. But you're also married.
It's over.
This is crazy. I'm a mother.
I have two children,
I have a husband, a beautiful home.
- I can't be fucking around with you.
- It was fun. It was fun, right?
- It was fun while it lasted.
- I'm glad. All right, well, good luck.
- No.
- Oh, my God, Dale!
- Please don't leave me.
- Oh, my God. Look at that whale.
Where?
Dale!
So I was with Seal...
...and we were just taking a chopper
up to Everest base camp...
...and the plot to my Sherpa...
- Derek. Derek.
- Sorry. Okay.
- Remember, we talked about this.
Dale, Brennan.
Tell me about the karaoke business.
Really great, Dad.
Yeah. We call it Karaoke 'n' Roll.
We got six bars, three restaurants,
and two more wanna sign up.
- So it's booming.
- Fantastic.
Most karaoke it's,
"Open to everyone.
- Hey, just get up and have fun."
- Not you guys.
If you can't sing, just sit down.
That's our motto.
- It's the big leagues.
- You guys are doing so great.
Guys, I have a little Christmas
surprise for Dale and Brennan.
- You wanna see it?
- Yes!
- You bet!
- Let's go look at it! Come on.
- Don't peek.
- I smell cookies.
Be patient. No, no. No, no.
- Just a piata, isn't it?
- Be patient. Be patient.
- Be patient.
- Did you get me a tiger, Dad?
Okay, open your eyes.
Merry Christmas.
Holy shit!
Dad, I can't believe
you put the boat in the tree!
This is amazing!
- It's The Gilded Lady. She lives!
- I can't believe it.
- How'd you get it up here?
- Oh, Robert, it's so great.
- Pirate hats!
- Pirate hats!
- Hustlers!
- Hustlers!
Dad, that was so thoughtful!
- Crossbows!
- Crossbows!
You guys finally came to your senses
and got us something cool.
You both know this is
completely fucked up, right?
- Yeah.
- Of course.
But Brennan sure can wear the shit
out of that pirate hat.
- Chewbacca masks!
- Chewbacca masks!
It's okay that mine's
not movie-quality.
But he's like, "No, because you drove
my car last week, so I can't get it."
So I'm like "You're gonna buy it for me
or I'm gonna sock you in the mouth."
Oh, shit.
Well, if it isn't Dale Doback
and his little butt buddy.
Sticks and stones
may break my bones...
...but I'm gonna kick you repeatedly
in the balls, Gardocki!
Let's get them!
- Where do you think you're going?
- Home.
- We got something to show you.
- Come on.
- You see that white dog crap?
- Do you see it?!
- Yeah.
- Not too fun down there, is it?
- No.
- You see?
Your actions have consequences!
When you oppress people,
they rise up in a fiery anger!
Go home.
We're not like you.
We're grown-ups, motherfucker!
Say hi to your dad.
We went to high school together.
The cops'll be here soon.
I guess this is what it feels like
to be grown up.
Hey.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah, of course.
You know back when
you first moved in?
Yeah.
- Did you touch my drum set?
- No, I didn't.
No, really, I won't get mad.
I just wanna know.
No, I know.
You said you wouldn't get mad.
I'm saying I didn't do it.
I didn't do it, I never did it.
- Then I owe you an apology.
- No.
No, you don't, at all. No.
Why wouldn't you take an apology
if you didn't do it?
Just because I'm cool.
It doesn't matter.
You got my passport.
I'm good.
Don't worry, not gonna be late.
Don't worry.

DAY 89.
DISAPPEARED! CONTACT THE POLICE.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Rocket.
Well done!
This is how... we're going
to escape this planet.
Go to your mother.
It's for the radio?
It will help us
amplify the signal.
For you.
Thanks.
It will soon darken.
Listen to me.
It's very noisy.
NEW YORK POST RUSTLES.
DAY 472.
THEY CAN HEAR YOU
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO SURVIVE.
GET UNDERGROUND.
CREATUREs:- BLIND.
- ATTACK SOUNDS.
- HOW MANY IN THE AREA?
- CONFIRMED 3.
S.O.S.
Sorry.

Thank you.
THE HUMAN EAR.
Beautiful...
I said Nothing...
DAY 473.
BIRTH DATE.
- Do not go down there!
- Why not?
- You don't know why...
- I'm going... I will not make any noise!
Don't do it.
Please.
This time, use these
little stereo amplifiers.
It will not work.
No, this should increase
the frequency to...
28min 19 - 29min 21
it never worked!
But...
We will continue to try, until it works.
Enough! Enough.
Enough!
Enough, already!
Remember... you have to divide.
We have three.
Amazing!
Time to leave.
Don't force me to go with him.
You'll be fine. Your father will
protect you. Always.
Look... It's important
that you learn these things.
also take care of me...
when I'm old... And gray...
And no longer have teeth...
Do not worry...
- I do not want to go...
- There is nothing to fear.
I will go...
You stay here. I need you to
stay here and help your mother.
I want to go.
You stay here.
You will be safe here.
She will go next time.
They are going to hear you!
Look at me.
Listen out.
The river... It's noisy.
The soft noises... are safe.
The loud noises... are not.
Unless...
There's another noise nearby...
Strong one...
You are safe.
Let me show you something.
You're alright.
You're alright.
I promise.
Why did't you let her come?
Do you blame her...
for what happened?
Don't...
Because she blames herself.
It's no one's fault...
You still love her, right?
Of course I do.
You should tell her.
Your mother...
I want you to make a noise...
Strong one.
Your mother... needs your help.
You can do it.
It's okay, it's okay...
You are safe.
They can't hear us.
It worked?
You just need to rest now.
Where are they?
Where are they?
I'll find them.
She was with me...
She was with me and then I had
to go down to laundry.
He was with you, wasn't he?
Rockets.
- He'll still be there?
- Surely.
He knows he should wait for you.
And she is...
She is smart...
You will find the place...
They know what to do.
It's a boy.
It's a boy.
I couldn't carred him.
He was heavy, isn't he?
Still... I can feel his
weight in my arms...
Small, but... So heavy...
And my hands were free...
I was carrying the bag...
But my hands were free.
You have to stop.
I'm sorry, I couldn't carred...
I should have carred.
Who are we?
We can't protect them.
Who are we?
You have to protect them.
Promise me...
that you will to protect them.
Don't worry...
He will come to us.
We can not stay here.
We must go.
He will come for us.
He will come for us.
He will come for you!
No, you're wrong
he told me!
Do not move.
Stop.
Are you fine?
Are you fine?
We must go to that truck.
Dad!
I love you.
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
SURVIVE -MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
- SOUND PROOFING.
WEAKNESS?
WHAT IS THE WEAKNESS?

Michael?
What are you doing? lt's after 12.
Couldn't sleep, Pops.
Neither can we,
with the noise you're making.
Let's go inside.
Just one more shot?
All right.
Just one.
Good. Shoot it again.
Getting pretty good. Shoot till you miss.
You think if l can get good enough,
l can go to college?
lf you get good enough,
you can do anything you want.
l want to play at North Carolina.
That's a real fine school.
You can get a good education.
l want to play on a championship team.
Then l want to play in the NBA.
All right, let's slow down, son.
Shouldn't you get some sleep first?
Once l've done all that...
...l want to play baseball, like you.
Baseball. Yeah, now, that's a sport.
When you've done that...
...l suppose you're going to fly?
At this time...
...l've reached the pinnacle of my
basketball career and must retire.
The one good thing is that my
father had the opportunity...
...to see me play my last game.
That means a lot.
What'll you do now?
l've never really told anybody this,
except for one person.
l'm going to play professional baseball.
What are you going to play?
l don't know. As a kid, l was a pitcher.
l think outfield,
because it'll be hard for me to pitch.
Let's get out of here. This stinks.
Don't bring me again.
Don't bring me again.
Are you listening?
Did you hear him? Did you hear him?
That little brat is right.
l told you, if l've told you once...
...l told you a thousand, thousand,
thousand, thousand times!
We need new attractions!
New ones!
Get it?
Big, shiny new things.
Absolutely, sir.
Look at me and listen:
The customer is always right!
Right!
The customer is always right!
Exactly!
Always!
Right!
Okay, we need something.
We need something...
...nutty!
Something wacky.
Wacky!
We need something, something....
Looney? Oops!
Looney. Thank you!
Looney?
Yes! Looney!
Now you're talking!
Looney! Looney! That's it!
That's the word l was looking for!
Get the Looney Tunes.
Bring them here.
Sir, just noticing...
...they're from Earth.
What if they can't come?
What did you say?
What if they can't come?
Make them.
Cool.
Make them!
We're gonna get them!
Strike!
Looks good in that uniform.
Looks great. Can't teach that.
Can't teach it.
Thanks for autographing
that basketball for my kid.
l'm happy to do it.
Let's go!
Curve ball. Don't swing.
Don't...swing.
Ball!
Fastball, outside corner. Swing.
Strike!
That was your pitch.
l know, l missed it.
l'll get you another one.
Podolak!
Come here.
-l'm sorry, l didn't mean to--
-Come here!
Make sure that nobody bothers Michael.
l want him to be the happiest player.
Slider. Don't swing.
Strike three!
l told you not to!
l couldn't help it.
l know. Nice talking to you!
We're not worried.
Good cut.
That was a good-looking strikeout.
You look good when you strike out.
When l do, it looks nasty.
At least you look good. Good-looking.
Hi, Mr. Jordan.
l'm Stan Podolak.
Oh, jeez.
You okay?
That was a nasty fall.
l'm Stan Podolak, Mr. Jordan,
the Baron's new publicist.
l'm here to make your life easier.
Can l drive you somewhere?
You want me to pick up your laundry,
baby-sit your kids?
l am here to personally guarantee...
...that no one will ever bother you.
What was that?
Hang on!
-Hanging on!
-Hanging on!
Are we there yet?
-Bombastic!
-Cool.
You irascible bunny!
Come back here, you screwy rodent!
l'll be with you in a second, folks,
after l finish with nature boy here.
All right, you pesky rabbit.
l've got you now!
One small step for moi....
One giant leap for Moron Mountain!
And one whopper headache for Elmer Fudd.
Diminutive, ain't they?
We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.
-Have you seen him?
-Where is he?
ls he around?
Bugs Bunny, Bugs Bunny.
Say, does he have great big long ears?
Like this?
Does he hop around...
...like this?
Does he say, ''What's up, doc?'' like this:
What's up, doc?
Nope! Never heard of him.
You know,
maybe there is no intelligent life...
...out in the universe after all.
Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune.
What do you think we are? Stupid?
Don't move a muscle.
Okay, bunny, gather up your Tune pals.
-We're taking you for a ride.
-Move it.
Totally. All right.
So, like, where are we going?
Are we there yet?
-Sorry it took so long.
-Don't worry about it.
That exit on 65 wasn't clearly marked.
-Hold up, right here.
-Here?
Thanks, Sherm.
-Appreciate it.
-lt's Stan, Mike.
You can call me Sherm if you want.
l follow your career and l think you're
the greatest athlete that's ever lived.
How do l get out?
The door doesn't work.
lt's a classic.
lt's a classic, but it's got
a few peccadillos. Hold on.
A few?
lt's smoking too.
Thanks for the ride.
This is nice. This is a nice house.
Beautiful. What is that, Colonial?
lt's a nice house.
lf you need help with the house....
l'm fine, thanks.
You gave me a ride. Thanks.
l'll drive tomorrow, so l don't need a ride.
But thanks, though.
Too conspicuous?
Yeah.
Thanks, though.
-Tomorrow!
-See you tomorrow.
Come on! No, not today!
Get off me! Your breath!
Mr. Jordan, are you okay?
Get off of him, Charles!
Bad dog! Git!
Pooch, stop it!
Get off of him before l cook you!
Come on, come on, baby.
Get out!
Good game.
Hey, Jeff, you okay?
-How was your game?
-l don't want to talk about it.
How are you?
You're covered with drool!
That's your dog.
What's wrong with Jeff?
He lost 32 points in his average.
ls that all?
So that puts him at .685 or something.
He's batting what?
Smells good in here. What you cooking?
Chicken.
Chicken and what?
Collard greens.
Good. l need a good meal tonight.
ls everything okay?
l stunk up the place.
Hope baseball was a good idea.
It was another career
day for Michael Jordan.
What're you watching?
He had 3 strikeouts.
ls this the only thing on TV?
What's up with this?
His batting average is .214,
which is his weight.
Get this guy a tennis racquet!
Did everyone get mad at you?
No. Worse.
They were nice about it.
I know golf is your sport.
But not here.
You should open your stance.
lt might make you more aggressive.
You think so? l'll remember that.
Watching this hurt me more than you.
Why are you watching this stuff?
lt's bad for you.
There.
Road Runner.
Stop this cartoon!
We've got an emergency Cartoon
Character Union Meeting to go to.
Hey, wait for me! Hold your horses!
Where'd they go?
Stop the music!
Top duck coming through!
Jeez! lt's getting so a guy can't
even get himself wet around here!
What's the big emergency?
These little guys would like to
make an announcement. Here.
You...
...all of you...
...are now our prisoners!
Oh, we're in big trouble now.
We are taking you to our
theme park in outer space.
No fooling.
You'll be our slaves.
And placed on display for the
amusement of our customers.
Oh, fear clutches my breast.
We ain't a-going...
...nowheres!
Not so fast, doc.
You just can't turn us into slaves.
That would be bad.
You must let us defend ourselves.
Oh, yeah? Who says?
Just a sec.
Read.
What's this?
''Give them a chance
to defend themselves.''
Do we have to?
lt's a rule.
Okay. lt is in the rule book.
Una momento!
We must confer.
All right, troops. lt is for us to
choose a battlefield that affords us--
l got it.
Yes, Private Porkster?
How about we challenge them to a...
...spelling bee?
Say...
...we could have a bowling tournament.
Suffering succotash!
What's wrong with you?
Let's get a ladder...
...wait till the old lady's gone...
...and grab that little bird!
Whoa! Take a deep breath, Sly!
Okay, let's analyze the competition.
Now what are we looking at here?
We got a small race of invading aliens....
Small arms! Short legs!
Not very fast.
Tiny little guys.
Can't jump high.
We challenge you to a basketball game.
Basketball it is!
Basketball!
What is basketball?
-What's that?
-Beats me.
We didn't have that in school.
Lights!
Pardon me! Sorry.
Down in front!
An exhilarating team sport currently
growing rapidly in popularity...
...is basketball.
Unlike football and baseball,
only 5 men can play on a team.
It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle
game that requires quick wits...
...and even faster reflexes.
Here's how it's done professionally.
The National Basketball Association...
...featuring the best players in the world.
The best players in the world!
The best!
Excuse me. Oh, so sorry.
Excuse me.
Get off my nose!
Quiet, they're looking!
lt's basketball!
Where?
Whoa! Now what?
-She's looking.
-Close it up.
Tightly.
You poked me again.
Sweetheart?
l thought you'd get better seats.
-This is the best l could get.
-This guy's doing something weird.
Just let me watch the game.
Barkley is killing us.
Someone's killing someone!
No. Seriously?
A killer!
Let me see!
There! That's the killer!
He's big.
He's good.
He's mine!
Go get him!
Come on! Get back on defense!
Let's go! Get back on d!
What are you doing?
Time out! Call time out!
What's wrong with you?
Let him in.
Open up!
Open!
He did it.
l got it! l got his talent!
Super.
-Sit down, Chuck.
-Man, l'm fine! l am fine!
l played you too much.
-l'm not tired!
-Get the doctor.
You all right?
You sure?
Come on, we're okay.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, Patrick. Showtime!
What's wrong with him?
In a shocking development, 5 NBA
players were put on the disabled list...
...in the last 24 hours, all suffering
from the same mysterious ailment...
...that affects the player's coordination.
l'll be home in a few days.
Put your mom on.
How you doing?
Watching TV?
What's going on?
-You gonna be all right?
-I'm ready, Coach.
Looks like l retired just in time.
l must go.
l'll call you later. Love you, bye.
lt's open!
lt's game time!
Lace up your Nikes.
Grab your Gatorade and we'll
get a Big Mac on the way.
Now we go to the Los Angeles Forum...
...where the Lakers are
refusing to take the court.
Get dressed.
We got a game in 5 minutes!
We're talking a huge fine.
We can't go in the locker room.
You heard what happened to
Barkley and Ewing. There's germs.
Cedric, that was in New York,
Bacteria travels faster
than the speed of light.
Like ''lnvasion of the Body Snatchers.''
All right.
Dress in the hallway.
Okay, okay, which one of you
maroons has ever played basketball?
l have, Coach.
And there's an important question
l must ask you.
What do you think?
l'm partial to purple and gold.
lt's better with my coloring.
Nice outfit, Daffy.
The little aliens say it's
their turn to use the court.
Sure, let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out.
Too bad you can't practice
getting taller, boys.
Hey, little pig!
l wet myself.
Time to play a little basketball.
These little pipsqueaks just
turned into superstars!
They're monsters!
Suffering succotash!
They're ''monstars''!
Bye-bye.
l think we might need some help.
Okay, little fella. You my friend?
Or my enemy?
You are my friend. You are my ally.
You are my associate,
my personal assistant.
You are my weapon. You are leaving.
-Great shot.
-Nice shot.
You can stop posing now.
Good try.
Not bad.
-Something for you to shoot at.
-Hit it good.
Do my best.
Good shot.
l know.
l must ask you something.
The NBA must face reality.
What's happening is serious.
They're going to need
new players with talent.
Skilled guys who never really
thought about a professional career.
Think l got a shot?
Come on, really?
Don't kid.
lt's a man's game.
-You can't play.
-What if l tried hard?
Keep it down.
lt's because l'm white.
No. Larry's white. So what?
Larry's not white. Larry's clear.
Get inside his ball!
You clowns can't beat that.
-My best shot ever.
-You haven't played long.
A Hall-of-Fame shot.
-Nice shot, Mr. Bird.
-Larry, please.
Nice shot, Mr. Larry.
Nice shot.
You can do this.
Don't be nervous, you can do this.
You feel the NBA has to face reality,
don't you?
Look for some players where
they never looked before.
Just look at the ball.
Visualize where you want it to go.
Be the ball.
Get off the tee.
Can't jump.
Go on.
Close to the pin?
For dinner?
-Sounds good.
-l'll go close to the pin.
l'll have some.
Not bad.
Good shot.
Get down.
Look at that spin.
Come on!
lt is alive!
My first hole in one.
Never seen one of these.
Nothing but the bottom of the cup.
-That's his ball too.
-Yeah, it's my ball.
Wait, let me get a picture!
You must smile.
Reach in for the ball and then smile, okay?
ls this good?
Just take the picture!
What kind of camera is that?
Don't point it at me.
-l didn't do anything!
-Where'd he go?
Look out for that first step,
doc, it's a real lulu.
Bugs Bunny?
You expected the Easter Bunny?
You're not real.
Not real? lf l weren't real, could l do this?
ls that Michael?
lt's Michael!
lt's Air Jordan.
Basketball!
l thought l saw....
l did. l did see Michael Jordan.
Pardon me, Mr. Jordan.
Can l have your auto--
Your John Hancock, please?
Let the doctor take a look.
A little high.
Going down!
So, what do you say we go for a little spin?
Let's see what we got inside here.
Say, ''Ahh.''
All right. He's okay!
What's going on here?
l thought you'd never ask.
These aliens from outer space want to
make us slaves in their theme park.
They're little. So we challenged
them to a basketball game.
Then, they ain't so little!
They're huge! We need to beat these guys.
They're talking about slavery!
They'll make us do stand-up,
the same jokes every night!
We'll be locked up like wild animals,
trotted out to perform...
...for a bunch of bug-eyed, fat-headed,
humor-challenged aliens!
What l'm trying to say is...
...we need your help!
l'm a baseball player now.
Right. And l'm a Shakespearean actor.
Mike?
Michael? lt's Stan.
Stan Podolak.
l need you to come out now, okay?
You got a baseball game tomorrow.
And I'd look pretty stupid
ifyou don't show up.
Think he's all right? l hate to leave him.
He's fine. l think he just had to
get away from that Stan character.
He's pathetic, isn't he?
l'll give us both twos. We weren't in
any kind of emotional state to putt.
l think that's fair.
lf Mike is gone, the NBA is
going to need some new people.
There's room at the top.
An exciting guy
who could even perform at half-time.
You know David Stern?
A phone call from you....
l want to help...
...but l haven't played in a long time.
My timing's off.
We'll fix it.
Look at our facility.
We got hoops.
We got weights.
We've got balls.
You sure do. This place is a mess.
You're worried about a mess?
There's nothing here a little
spit shine wouldn't fix.
Spit shine!
Lemony-fresh.
You guys are nuts.
Correction: We're Looney Tunes.
And as such are the exclusive property
and trademark of Warner Bros. lnc.
l'm here!
Me too!
That hurt.
Who are they?
Remember the tiny aliens l told you about?
You've heard of the Dream Team?
We're the Mean Team, wussieman!
Wussieman.
We're the Monstars.
M-o-n-....
Let's see what you got...
...chump!
l don't play basketball anymore.
''l don't play basketball anymore.''
Maybe you're chicken.
l say, l resemble that remark.
You calling me chicken?
Come here.
Here you go. Take him!
Watch the footwork.
Can you believe it?
Get out of the way!
Everybody.
Look at your hero now.
You guys are making a mistake.
You're all washed up, baldy!
Baldy?
He is not washed up!
-Michael's the greatest!
-Shut up!
My poor little cranium.
You okay?
Yeah, are you okay?
Whoops!
You're not scared of them...
...are you?
Let's play some basketball.
You're...!
You're Charles Barkley.
Girls! Come on over! Hurry up! Hurry!
Look! lt's Charles Barkley!
Can l play?
You're not Charles Barkley.
Just a wanna-be who looks like him.
Sorry.
Break out.
You shouldn't even be here! Be gone!
Wanna-be! Be gone!
Just a few more tests.
Electrolyte levels,
glucose, CBCs, RBCs, etc.
And we've scheduled a stress test...
...and neurological battery
to include EEG and....
And this girl...
...five feet nothing, blocked my shot.
When did you first have this dream?
lt wasn't a dream! lt really happened!
lt climbed up my back...
...and into my brain.
Are there other areas...
...besides basketball...
...where you find yourself...
...unable to perform?
No!
Just asking.
l've been MRl'd, EKG'd,
x-rayed, laser beamed....
l'll never swear again.
l'll never get another technical.
l'll never trash-talk.
l've got other skills.
l could go work on the farm.
Really?
Or maybe l could go back to
the jungle and be a missionary.
What are you saying?
That l'm trying to disobey my mama?
You said that, not me.
l love her.
Still can't find anything wrong!
Maybe nothing's wrong!
Maybe it's just in our head.
We're fine. lt's psychosomatic.
Or has to do with the moon.
l'll never date Madonna again.
What are you doing?
l'm fixing a divot.
He's fixing a divot!
Has anyone here ever played basketball?
l have.
l'd like to try out.
Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.
Lola?
Hello!
My name's Bugs.
You want to play one-on-one, doll?
''Doll''?
On the court, Bugs.
She's hot!
Ready?
l got it! l got it!
That girl's got some skills.
Don't ever call me...
...''doll.''
Check!
Nice playing with you.
Very smooth.
She's obviously nuts about me.
Obviously.
Mais oui.
Where's the ball?
Let's do some drills.
Can anyone lend me some sneakers?
Sneakers?
Sorry.
Someone must get my gear
from my house.
Your house?
ln 3-D land?
Whatever you do...
...remember my North Carolina shorts.
Your shorts? From college?
l wore them under my Chicago Bulls
uniform every game.
l washed them after every game!
l did!
The view back here stinks.
We're in front of his house.
l knew that!
Let's go in this way.
l say, let's go in that way!
He just never learns!
Let me see.
l must be very, very...
...close.
Mother!
Nice digs.
Well, well. l wonder who that could be.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
Everyone's sleeping!
l knew that.
Come on, we must find
Michael's basketball stuff.
Nope. Nothing in here.
Nope.
But a very nice dinette set.
Not here.
Let's look upstairs.
Yes, Oh, Fearless Leader.
So, he needs his special underwear.
Sorry.
You think she's got enough toys?
Speaking of toys,
you know all those mugs and...
...lunch boxes with our pictures on them?
You ever see any money from it?
-Not a cent.
-Me neither.
lt's a shame.
We need a new agent.
We're getting screwed.
We've found the trophy room.
Spread out and search the place.
Yes, sahib.
Oh, brother.
Here l am, in the peak of my form...
...playing second banana to
some sort of harebrain....
This could be useful.
lf this were a union job....
That's very nice.
-l could use this.
-One of his shoes.
Where is the other shoe?
Where are you?
Eureka!
Come to Papa.
What a fuzz-foot. You are so clumsy.
Catch.
Thanks.
Time to go.
Did we get everything?
The shorts!
ln there?
Okay, l'll check.
l found the shorts.
The pain!
l'm right behind you.
That's not reassuring.
Nice puppy.
Want a bone?
No dice.
How about a nice ham?
Can't we talk this over?
Down, Beethoven.
The kids are here.
Give it.
Here.
Thanks, kid.
Bad dog!
That is the last time l'm ever
working with dogs or children.
Where you going?
You see, the Looney Tunes have a
big basketball game coming up and...
-...your dad's playing.
-All right!
Yeah! But don't tell anybody!
l see aliens.
Little aliens from outer space.
They forced their way inside your bodies.
They need your talent to win a...
...basketball game against...
...Bugs Bunny.
l also see Michael Jordan...
...being sucked down a golf hole...
...by furry creatures.
That's it. We're going.
We're leaving.
Let's try acupuncture.
Good idea.
This is it! This is it!
l don't know where you are...
...but you obviously enjoy being
there more than being with me!
You better hope this Jordan
character still can play.
You and me both, brother.
Listen, how is this for a new team name:
The Ducks.
Please!
What kind of Mickey Mouse
organization would name a team that?
So sue me. lt's just a suggestion.
You're doing it!
You're becoming mighty!
Go!
No pain, no gain.
Guys?
Look who's finally ready to play!
Let's see if l remember how.
ls it really you?
Thank God you're all right!
l was so worried!
Come on, Stan. Don't hug me, please.
Sorry.
-Why are you here?
-l must take you back for practice.
l can't. l'm helping my friends
in their basketball game.
Your friends are cartoon characters.
Yeah. So?
lt doesn't bother me.
Let me help? Let me help! l can help!
What can you do?
l may not be tall, but...
...l'm slow.
And large.
And a dork!
l'll do anything! Anything!
Anything?
Anything.
Come here. Come here for a second.
Sit right here.
No problem.
All right! All right, let's go, team!
lf someone gets injured,
we could see a lot of minutes.
l'm a cheerleader.
Mr. Commissioner, the place is sealed off.
Quiet!
Listen. After meeting with team owners...
...l decided that until we can guarantee...
...the health of our players...
...there will be no more
basketball this season.
Just get out of my way.
Ready?
Let's go!
Are these the best seats?
Like them!
Can see everything from here! Very good!
Ready to go?
Yeah, sure.
Riot!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...the starting lineup for...
...the Tune Squad!
Standing 2 foot 4...
...The Wonder From Down Under...
...the Tazmanian Devil!
At small forward...
...standing a scintillating 3 foot 2...
...The Heartthrob of the Hoops...
...Lola Bunny!
At power forward...
...The Quackster of the Courts: Daffy Duck!
Thank you! Thank you!
Very funny.
Let's all laugh at the duck.
And at point guard...
...standing 3 foot 3,
...co-captain of the Tune Squad...
...The Doctor of Delight:
Bugs Bunny!
Thank you! Thank you!
And now...
...the player-coach of the Tune Squad...
...at 6 foot 6, from North Carolina...
...His Royal Airness:
Michael Jordan!
Who?
ls he a Looney Tune?
Perhaps.
Ready?
l'll take it to the rack.
They'll wish they never were born!
Guys, let's just go out and have fun.
The challengers for the Ultimate Game...
...all the way from Moron Mountain:
The Monstars!
Go Monstars! Go Monstars!
Go Monstars!
What are you looking at?
Cool shoes.
Ready?
l got it! l got the ball!
Way to go!
Did you see the moves on that one?
Come on. Show me something!
The duck!
Oh, my!
She was wide open.
Watch the screen!
Watch out!
Get him!
How did he do that?
Nice shot, Mr. J.
Let's play defense.
Way to go!
Air J!
Red light!
Feed me!
Feed you?
Feed me!
-Bad old putty tat!
-l'll take that.
Don't try this at home!
''l wish l was in the land of--''
Going somewhere?
May l remind you, sir...
...that physical violence is
patently against the rules!
Did you order Original Recipe
or Extra Crispy?
Let's go.
Me?
l'm ready. l can do this.
You picked the mouse?
l love basketball. l always have. Do you?
l bet you're good.
l'm small, but l try hard to be good.
l always try hard.
My mom says, ''Try your best--''
Try to get by me, doll.
''Doll''?
Don't ever call me...
...''doll.''
Nice shot.
There's the defense boy. l got you.
Pie? Pork chop?
Sorbet, perhaps?
Half-time.
Holy Putty Tat!
We're better than them.
We got them.
Moron Mountain, here we come.
We're going to be slaves.
There's a whole other half to play.
lt's the boss.
Hello, Mr. Swackhammer!
All right.
Not bad for the first half.
But we must keep this up.
No problem.
We stole talent from the NBA players!
From the NBA!
Shut up!
l smell something.
We've been playing hard.
Not you, you idiot!
lt's coming from over here.
That locker.
Look!
lt's the chubby boy!
lt smells like a...
...spy!
You guys need a publicist?
l can make you big.
-l know we're down.
-Let's hear the story.
l've been here before.
We can still win this.
lt's not over. We must come together.
We must believe in ourselves.
That'll help us.
Looks like Stan had a close
encounter with a bug-zapper.
The Monstars!
The Monstars!
That must hurt.
The Monstars!
The Monstars...
...stole the talent from the NBA players.
So that's what happened to them.
l think we should qui-- qui-- forfeit.
Listen, l didn't get dragged down
here to lose to ugly Monstars.
l ain't going out like that.
We're letting them push us!
We must fight back!
We must get right in their faces!
Well?
Are you with me or not?
Finished? Great speech and all.
You had them riveted.
But didn't you forget something?
Your secret stuff!
Nice deltoids!
Play along.
Stop hogging it.
We're teammates!
Secret stuff?
Secret stuff? You wouldn't
hold out on us, would you?
No.
l didn't think you needed it.
You're so tough. You're competitive.
We're also chicken. We need it bad.
-l'd like some of that.
-Could l have a sip, please?
This goes against everything
l learned in health class.
Do you want to win?
Bottoms up.
Yummy.
How about we go out
and kick some alien butt?
How about it? Ready?
Open!
Coming through!
Special delivery!
Nice kaboom.
Let's teach them a lesson.
Nice butt!
Going up!
Slammy!
Hello! A little surprise for you, my friends.
This will be good.
Okay, birdie!
Time out!
Shut up, get away from me. Powwow!
We're right back in this game.
Let's play tough defense.
Why didn't you get him?
He's a baseball player.
A baseball player.
Looks like a basketball player to me.
Me too.
He's the one l want for Moron Mountain.
Are you talking to me?
Yeah, l am. You want a piece of me?
Come and get it!
What do you have in mind?
What about we raise the stakes?
lnteresting.
lf we win, you give the NBA
players their talent back.
But what if we win?
lf you win?
You get me.
Good deal.
Doc, you think that's a good idea?
You'll be our star attraction.
You'll sign autographs all day long.
And play one-on-one with
the paying customers.
And lose.
Do we have a deal?
Deal.
l don't think you should do this.
l have faith in my team.
Crush them!
Defeating time, boys.
Good-bye!
Fore!
But, Mommy,
l don't want to go to school today.
l want to stay home
and bake cookies with you.
l'm open!
Heads up!
Belly flop!
Oh, my!
ls this your man?
You okay?
Me? Oh, yeah. l'm fine.
Are you okay?
Thank you.
lt was nothing.
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.
Time out.
l could have been a contender!
The Monstars! The Monstars!
l could have had a V-8!
We need a fifth player.
You got any more secret stuff?
l think it's starting to wear off.
lt didn't wear off. lt was water.
You guys had the ''special stuff''
inside you all along.
Yeah, l knew that. But you got any more?
Can l have some?
-Stan?
-Me?
You're center.
Just guard the big guy.
Guard him? l'll smother him!
l'll be all over him like a cheap suit!
l'll be on him like stink on rice!
He's going down!
Over here!
Over here!
l'm open!
Nice shot!
Big man, ain't he?
Let's get him out of here!
Oh, my!
How'd he do that?
Anyone can do that.
Even you.
Watch this.
No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land.
Thanks for telling me, doc.
l hate to be the bearer of bad news,
Your Airness...
...but if you don't find a fifth player,
your team will forfeit the game.
Forfeit?
Precisely, Sir Altitude.
No way. We'll find someone.
l didn't know Dan Ackroyd
was in this picture!
Perhaps l could be of some assistance?
That's our fifth guy.
Now you get to live your dream. Let's go.
-We need to score 2 points.
-Here's how l see it.
You kick it to the girl
bunny down in the post.
You dish it to Bugs.
You swing it to Mike. You go to the hole.
-And dominate!
-We're on defense!
l don't play defense.
Typical.
You must listen to Mike on this.
Someone steal the ball,
get it to me and l'll score.
Don't lose that confidence!
Paws and wings in here! Okay!
This is why l was born.
l thrive on pressure.
Excuse me, sorry.
Easy on the trousers, Daf.
Pardon me. Mr. Murray,
something's really been bugging me.
Just how did you get here?
Producer's a friend of mine.
Had a teamster drop me off.
That's how it goes.
You see this chunky fellow?
That's good!
Let's do it!
Play fair.
Don't choke now. Come on.
lt's gut-check time!
This must be mine.
l'm going this way! l'm going left!
Never trust an Earthling!
Get the girl!
Come on!
l'm open!
-That's mine!
-Not today!
Bring it on, dude.
You're mine!
l'm open!
Never mind.
The Tunes win!
Nice pass.
Great stretch at the basket too.
You really got some skills.
You could play in the NBA.
Thanks, Mike.
l'll probably quote you on that.
But l'm going to take this opportunity
to retire from the game.
Come on.
No,
l'm going to retire right now and that's it.
l'm going to go out undefeated.
That's how it will be.
-You go celebrate.
-Come with us.
l'd like to, but l have to ice down my
knees now. They're starting to go.
Good-bye.
See you.
You sure?
Yes. Definitely sure. Definitely.
-Losers!
-Sorry.
-Choke artists!
-Sorry again.
Wait till l get you back
on Moron Mountain.
The party's over! Get in the spaceship.
Why do you take that?
Because he's bigger.
He's bigger?
Than we used...
...to be.
What're you doing?
-Wait! What are you doing? Wait!
-Come here.
Had it in you all the time.
One thing. Pass me the ball, Bugs.
Give my friends their talent back.
Do we have to?
lt's part of the deal. Touch the ball.
Fair is fair.
Touch it.
That was so much fun.
l feel so...
...insignificant.
My clothes don't fit.
What a trip!
l'm up for another!
Can we ask you a favor, Mr. Bunny?
We don't want to go back.
-We hate it there.
-lt stinks.
l was thinking, could we stay here?
Please!
Oh, brother.
l don't know if you guys
are looney enough.
Looney enough?
Do you know what time it is?
Seven-fift-- Seven-fift--
Quarter past seven.
You have a baseball game in 5 minutes!
Okay. Take this.
ls it safe?
Yeah, put it in my bag.
Let's go.
l enjoyed playing with you.
You've got a lot of....
Whatever it is, you got a lot of it.
Got to go.
Stay out of trouble.
You know l will.
Come here!
The delay is killing us.
Where's Michael?
Where is Michael?
He's not back from his other game.
What game?
What other game?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...Michael Jordan!
Guys...
...we suck!
My grandmother plays better.
You guys are still tall.
l'm nothing now. Just a short guy.
You're right.
That's the only thing you got right.
-Who's that?
-Who is it?
l don't know.
You've been getting beaten.
lt's Mike.
-What's up?
-Why're you here?
Don't be embarrassed.
Just face it.
You stink.
Lighten up.
l know.
You want your games back.
What games you had.
lt's hard enough as it is.
Give us a break.
l'm going to regret this.
Give me the ball.
lt's like ''Star Trek.''
Touch it.
No way, Jose.
You want your talent back? Just touch it.
-l don't know.
-Don't touch it.
You'll walk around with a bad game
for the rest of your career. Touch it.
Careful, Pat.
We've tried everything else.
Come on.
Touch it.
The rest of you.
Just touch it.
-What was that?
-l liked that.
l caught it!
Look at Mugsey handle the rock!
l can handle it again!
That's the old Mugs l know.
Yeah, get height now!
lt gave me my powers back!
Let me show you something.
The Round-Mound is back!
Want to see something?
That felt good!
-l got it.
-You got it. Yeah, baby.
Stay.
Play some 3-on-3 with us?
l don't think so.
You going to work on your swing?
Leave the baseball player alone.
He doesn't play basketball now.
He probably doesn't have it anymore.
Do you hear them?
They don't think you can play the game.
There's one way to find out.
The Chicago Bulls is
proud to welcome back...
...Michael Jordan!
What's the matter?
Larry could have been me.
Will you get off that kick? lt's over.
lt's done with. You can't play.
Let's go, Bulls!
Well, that's all, folks!
That's my line.
Step aside, Babe. Let a star do this.
That's all--
That's all, folks!
Can l go home now?

[ Bird Chirping ]
[ Insects Buzzing,
Chittering ]
[ Gasps ]
No, no, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
I'm lost!
Where's the line?
It just went away.
What do I do?
- Help!
- We'll be stuck here forever!
Do not panic.
Do not panic!
We are trained professionals.
Now, stay calm.
We are going around the leaf.
A-Around the leaf?
I don't think we can do that.
Oh, nonsense. This is nothing
compared to the twig of'93.
- [ Whimpering ]
- That's it. That's it. Good!
You're doing great!
There you go. There you go!
Watch my eyes.
Don't look away.
- And here's the line again.
- Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Soil.
[ Laughing ]
Good job, everybody!
Oh, my.
There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil.
- Shouldn't we tell the queen?
- I don't think we need
to involve the queen in this.
She's got enough on her plate already,
training her daughter.
Oh, yes.
Princess Atta, the poor dear.
Oh, wind's died down.
They'll be here soon.
-Just be confident, dear.
You'll be fine.
- [ Gasps ] There's a gap.
There's a gap in the line.
What are we gonna do?
It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen.
We just lost a few inches, that's all.
Oh. Right.
Your Highness, I can't count
when you hover like that.
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- Guys, go shade
someone else for a while.
- [ Pet Chirps ]
Okay, Atta.
Now what do we do?
Ahh-- Oh! Don't tell me.
I know it. What is it?
- We relax.
- [ Chuckles ] Right.
Oh, it'll be fine.
It's the same, year after year.
They come, they eat, they leave.
That's our lot in life.
It's not a lot, but it's our life.
[ Laughs ]
[ Chuckles ]
Isn't that right, Aphie?
Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.
[ Rumbling ]
- Ditch Dot!
- Yeah, yeah!
Hey, come back here!
[ Strains, Grunts ]
- Dot!
- Yes, Mother.
What did I tell you
about trying to fly?
Not until my wings grow in.
- Right.
- But Mom--
Dot, you're a young queen ant
and your wings are too little--
I was talking to Mother.
You're not the queen yet, Atta.
Now, Dot,
be nice to your sister.
It's not my fault
she's so stressed out.
[ Sighs ]
I know, I know.
- I'm always acting
like the sky is falling.
- Look out!
- Atta!
- Princess Atta!
- Oh!
- Hey!
-Stop that!
- What do you think you're doing?
- You could have killed
somebody over here.
- [ Gasps ] I'm sorry!
- Oh, it's Flik.
- Oh--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!
- Please forgive me. I'm sorry!
- [ Coughing ]
- [ Screams ] Princess Atta!
- Flik, what are you doing?
Oh, this! This is my new idea
for harvesting grain.
No more picking individual kernels.
You cut down the entire stalk!
- We don't have time for this.
- Exactly! We never have time
to collect food for ourselves.
We spend all summer
harvesting for the offering.
- But my invention will
speed up production.
- Oh, another invention?
Something for you too.
Since you're gonna be queen, you could
use this to oversee production.
- Dr. Flora, if I may.
- This is all very nice, but--
-Just an ordinary blade of grass
and a bead of dew, right?
- Flik, please.
- Wrong! It is, in fact, a telescope.
- [ Both Laugh ]
- It's very clever, Flik, but--
- Hello, Princess! Aren't you
looking lovely this morning!
Not that you would need
a telescope to see that.
Listen! The princess doesn't
have time for this!
You wanna help fill this thing?
Get rid of that machine,
get back in line and pick grain
like everybody else!
- Like everybody else!
- Please, Flik. Just go.
I'm sorry,
I was really just trying--
trying to help.
Harvester. Why, we harvested
the same way ever since I was a pupa.
[ Sighs ]
Where were we?
- The food pile, Your Highness.
- Oh, yes, yes.
Hey, Flik! Wait up!
Oh. Hello, Princess.
You can call me Dot.
Here, you forgot this.
Thanks. You can keep it.
I can make another one.
- I like your inventions.
- Really? Well, you're the first.
- I'm beginning to think
nothing I do works.
- This works.
Great. One success.
[ Sighs ]
- I'm never gonna make a difference.
- Me, neither.
I'm a royal ant and I can't
even fly yet. I'm too little.
- Being little's not such a bad thing.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
- Is too!
- Is not. Is not! Is not!
- Is too. Is too! Is too!
Oh! A seed.
I need a seed. Ahh--
Ohh!
Ah, here, here.
Pretend-- pretend
that that's a seed.
- It's a rock.
- I know it's a rock.
But let's just pretend for a minute it's
a seed. We'll just use our imaginations.
Now, do you see our tree?
Everything that made
that giant tree...
is already contained
inside this tiny little seed.
All it needs is some time, a little bit
of sunshine and rain, and...
voila!
This rock will be a tree?
Seed to tree. You've gotta
work with me, all right?
You might not feel
like you can do much now,
but that's just because,
well, you're not a tree yet.
You just have to give yourself
some time. You're still a seed.
But it's a rock.
I know it's a rock!
Don't ya think I know a rock
when I see a rock? I've spent
a lot of time around rocks!
You're weird, but I like you.
[ Horn Sounds ]
[ Gasps ] They're here.
- [ Gasping ]
- [ Horn Continues ]
[ Panicked Chattering ]
- They're coming!
- Run!
- Dot! Dot!
- Mom!
- Mom!
- Thank heavens!
- Food to the offering stone.
- [ Whistles ] Everyone, single file.
Food to the offering stone
and into the anthill. Now let's go!
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, keep movin', keep movin'!
Good. [ Panting ]
Okay. That's everyone.
[ Flik ]
Hey!
Hey, wait for me!
Get the food to the offering stone,
then into the anthill.
[ Screams ]
No! No, no, no, no, no!
Oh, oh!
Oh, no.
Princess Atta!
Princess Atta!
Princess Atta!
[ Rumbling ]
[ Whimpering ]
They come, they eat, they leave.
They come, they eat, they leave.
Excuse me, pardon me.
Pardon me, excuse me. Coming through.
Sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta,
there's something I need to tell you.
- Not now, Flik. Shh!
- But Your Highness,
it's about the offering!
-[ Rumbling Stops ]
-[ Male Voice ] Hey, what's goin' on?
Yeah, where's the food?
[ All Gasp ]
- What did you do?
- It was an accident?
[ Laughs Maniacally ]
Boo!
[ Laughs ]
- Where's the food?
- [ Whimpering ]
- Hopper.
- [ Gasps ]
So, where is it?
Where's my food?
- I-I-Isn't it up there?
- What?
- The food was in a leaf
sitting on top--
- Excuse me.
Are you sure
it's not up there?
- Are you saying I'm stupid?
- No.
Do I look stupid... to you?
Let's just think about the logic,
shall we? Think about it for a second.
If it was up there,
would I be coming down here,
to your level,
looking for it?
- Uh, I--
- Why am I even talking to you?
You're not the queen.
You don't smell like the queen.
Sh-She's learning
to take over for me, Hopper.
Oh, I see. Under new management.
So it's your fault.
No, it wasn't me, it was--
Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership:
Everything is your fault.
- But-But I--
- It's a bug-eat-bug world
out there, Princess,
one of those circle-of-life
kind of things.
Now, let me tell you
how things are supposed to work.
The sun grows the food,
the ants pick the food,
the grasshoppers eat the food--
And the birds eat the grasshoppers.
Hey, like the one that nearly ate you,
you 'member? Oh, you shoulda seen it.
This blue jay has
him halfway down his throat,
and Hopper's kickin' and screamin'.
And I'm scared.
I'm not goin' anywhere near, okay?
Aw, come on.
It's a great story. Ow, ow, ow.
I swear, if I hadn't promised
Mother on her deathbed...
that I wouldn't kill you,
I would kill you.
- And believe me, no one
appreciates that more than I do.
- Shut up!
I don't want to hear another word
out of you while we're on this island.
- Do you understand me?
- [ Whimpers ]
- I said, do you understand me?
- How can I answer? You said
I couldn't say another word.
- Remember Ma!
- [ Growls ]
Hey, I'm a compassionate insect.
There's still a few months
till the rains come,
so you can all just try again.
But, Hopper, since it's
almost the rainy season,
we need this time
to gather food for ourselves.
Listen, if you don't
keep your end of the bargain,
then I can't guarantee your safety.
And there are insects out there
that will take advantage of you.
Someone could get hurt.
[ Snaps Fingers ]
[ Screeching ]
[ Snarling, Screeching ]
[ Gasps, Squeals ]
What's the matter?
You scared of grasshoppers?
[ Whimpering ]
- Dot!
- You don't like Thumper?
- [ Snarls ]
- Leave her alone!
You want her?
Go ahead-- take her.
No?
Then get back in line.
It seems to me that you ants
are forgetting your place.
So let's double
the order of food.
- [ Gasps ]
- No! But-But--
We'll be back
at the end of the season,
when the last leaf falls.
You ants have a nice summer.
Let's ride!
- Yee-ha!
- [ Grasshoppers Shouting ]
[ Laughing ]
Ooh!
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
Flik, what do you have
to say for yourself?
Sorry. I-- I'm sorry
for the way I am.
I didn't mean for things
to go so wrong.
I especially didn't want
to make you look bad, Princess.
- Well, Flik, ya did.
- I was just trying to help.
- Then help us-- don't help us.
- Help, help. Help?
Flik, you are sentenced to
one month digging in the tunnels.
Excuse me, Your Highness.
Need I remind you of Flik's
tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?
Helpers to help us.
That's it! We could--
It took two days to dig him out.
Send him to Health and Ant Services.
Heavens, no!
We could leave the island,
the river bed's dry.
We could walk across and get helpers.
We could! We could go
find helpers to help us.
- It's perfect!
- Perfect? What's so perfect?
Your Highness, don't you see?
We could send someone to get help!
- [ All Gasp ]
- Leave the island?
Why didn't I think of that?
Oh! Because it's suicide!
-She's right! We never leave the island.
-Never leave!
There's snakes and birds
and bigger bugs out there!
Exactly! Bigger bugs!
We could find bigger bugs
to come here and fight...
and forever rid us
of Hopper and his gang!
- Ludicrous!
- Who would do a crazy thing like that?
- I'll volunteer.
I'd be happy to volunteer.
- [ Laughing ]
You got a lot of spunk, kid,
but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.
At least we could try. I could travel
to the city! I could search there!
If you went, you'd be
on that silly search for weeks.
Royal huddle.
- Great idea, Princess. It's perfect!
- Exactly.
- Wait a minute.
What did we just decide here?
- To let Flik leave.
While we keep harvesting
to meet Hopper's demands.
- You see, with Flik gone, he can't--
- He can't mess anything up!
Flik, after much deliberation, we have
decided to grant you your request.
- Really?
- Really?
- Uh, really.
Oh, thank you, Princess.
Thank you so much for this chance.
- I won't let you down,
I promise, I promise, I promise.
- That's fine. No, forget it.
- I should help repair
the damage before I go.
- [ All ] No! No, no!
[ Elderly Ant ]
Just leave!
[ Breathes Deeply ]
Hey.
Don't worry!
The colony is in good hands!
Bye, now.
[ Ants Cheering ]
All right.
Hey, fellas.
Beautiful mornin', huh?
My dad gives you one hour
before you come back crying.
Does he, now?
- My dad doesn't think that.
- He doesn't, huh?
- Naw, he's bettin' you're gonna die.
- Oh.
He says if the heat doesn't get ya,
the birds will.
I think he's gonna make it.
-Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
-Yeah, Dot. What do you know?
Hey, hey, hey.
Ease up. Come on.
She's entitled
to her opinion too.
[ Gasps ]
[ Birds Cawing ]
Ohh.
- So go, already.
- [ Exhales ]
- Hey!
- The city's that way.
- I know.
- You're supposed to look for bugs,
not dandelions.
You leave him alone.
He knows what he's doing.
That's right.
Here I go. For the colony,
and for oppressed ants everywhere!
Whoa-oh.
- Wow!
- Hey!
- Hey-hey!
- Bye, Flik!
Wow!
[ Chuckling ]
Wow. Ohh!
Whoa!
[ Dot ]
Good luck, Flik!
Bye! Whoa-oh!
Flik!
[ Muffled ]
I'm... okay!
- Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
- You just watch.
He's gonna get the bestest,
roughest bugs you've ever seen!
[ Growls, Roars ]
Get back! Get back!
Get back, you horrible beast!
- [ Roaring ]
- I have no fear! Aye-eee!
- Ooh!
- Oh, my goodness.
- [ Sobbing ]
- Oh, no!
[ Crowd Boos, Hisses ]
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim. An owie?
- Owie! Owie, owie.
Please show Rosie the owie.
All right, Dim. It's okay.
I have been in outhouses
that didn't stink that bad.
This is ridiculous.
What a disappointment!
- Oh, no!
- You! Come here! I want my money back!
Uh, no refunds
after the first two minutes.
Popcorn! Stale popcorn!
We're losin' the audience!
You clowns get out there now!
- I hate performing on an empty stomach!
- Do your act, Heimlich.
- Then you can eat. Not now, Slim.
- P.T., what's the point?
What's the point of going out there?
They'll only laugh at me.
- That's because you're a clown!
- No, it's because I'm a prop!
You always cast me as the broom,
the pole, the stick, a splinter.
You're a walking stick.
It's funny!
- Now go!
- You parasite.
Tra-la-la-la-la.
Spring's in the air.
And I'm a flower with
nothing interesting to say.
- [ Screams ]
- A bee!
I am a cute little bumblebee!
Here I come!
[ Screams ]
Slow down, you flowers!
[ Groans ]
Candy corn! Here,
let me help you to finish it.
Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate
with a real bug? [ Laughs ]
Ooh, come to papa!
So, bein' a ladybug automatically makes
me a girl, is that it, flyboy? Huh?
- She's a guy!
- Francis, leave them alone.
- They are poo-poo heads!
- Not again.
Judging by your breath, you must have
been buzzin' around a dung heap all day.
- Come on, Francis.
You're making the maggots cry.
- [ Wailing ]
[ Vocalizing ]
All right, we're dyin' out there.
Gypsy, quick! You and Manny--
- Shh! He's in a trance.
- [ Humming ]
Well, get him out of it!
You and your husband are up now.
Manny, we're on.
Oh? Yet again it is up to me
to rescue the performance.
- Gypsy, come.
- [ Humming ]
[ Crashing ]
- The stage is the other way, dear.
- Yes, of course.
Anytime, pal!
- I'm gonna pick the hairs
out of your head one by one!
- Take your best shot!
- You name the place!
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, 'cause when you
get there, you are dead!
- Francis, let me handle this.
- That's no way to speak to a lady.
- I heard that, you twig.
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me
to present Manto the Magnificent...
and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!
From the most mysterious
regions of uncharted Asia,
I give you the Chinese Cabinet...
of Metamorphosis!
Rosie, whole troupe.
Onstage! Finale! Now!
- Okay, I just need time to--
Coming, coming.
- Now!
Tuck, Roll, let's get moving, guys.
We're up next.
[ Speaking Foreign Language ]
Don't you understand?
We are up!
- " Up-a."
- [ Chattering ]
- Hey!
- Hey! They don't understand me.
I summon the voice
of Confucius--
Get off the stage,
you old hack!
[ Shrieks ]
I demand to know who said that!
- [ Laughing ]
- How dare you!
Ingrates!
[ Gypsy ]
Manny? Manny!
I only got 24 hours to live
and I ain't gonna waste it here.
Come on.
[ Screams ] I've just about
had it with these losers!
Flaming death!
I hold in my hand the match--
the match that decides whether two bugs
live or die this very evening.
In a moment, I will light
this trail of matches...
leading to a sheet of flypaper
dowsed in lighter fluid!
Aimed directly at the flypaper
are Tuck and Roll,
the pill bug cannonballs!
The cannon
will be triggered by Dim,
trained to jump
at the sound of this bell...
set to go off in 15 seconds.
Our pill bugs' only hope
of survival is...
our mistress
of the high wire, Rosie!
Secured to a web line
of exact length,
Rosie will plummet down
to these two posts,
spinning a web of safety
in less than 15 seconds!
Not good enough, you say?
Well, what if they were all...
blindfolded!
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I suggest that those of you...
with weak constitutions
leave the arena,
- for this act is so dangerous...
- [ Bickering ]
that if the slightest thing
should go wrong--
- No!
- Go? Okay, through the tunnel--
- Whoa!
- [ Bell Dings ]
- [ Chuckling ]
- Whoa!
- [ Screams ]
- P.T!
- Oh, no!
- Oh!
- [ Whimpering ]
- Water! We need some water!
- Water, water, water!
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Grunting ]
Get me outta here!
Oof!
[ Laughs ]
- [ Laughing ]
- Wow!
- It's the web. I'm sorry.
- You're all fired.
- We got the water!
- Here we come, P.T!
Whoo! Whoa!
Burn 'im again!
No, Harry, no!
Don't look at the light!
I can't help it!
It's so beautiful!
[ Screams ]
Try not to look
like a country bug.
Blend-- blend in.
[ Male Voice ]
Hey, buggy!
What do you expect?
The guy's a tick.
Wow! The city!
[ Laughing ]
Wow!
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Making all stops to the septic tank,
including standing water,
empty bean can and dead rat.
- Watch your stingers. All aboard!
- Whoa!
- Hey! Oh, sorry.
- Get out of the way!
- Watch where you're goin'!
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.
- [ Violin Sound ]
- [ Gasps ] Oh, sorry!
Oh. I'm really, really sorry.
That was
an-an-an ac-ac-accident.
- Hey, let go of me!
- I'll show ya who's tough!
- And stay out!
- Tough bugs!
- I knew an old lady
who swallowed a fly--
- Wow!
- Move it!
- Whoa!
[ Male Fly ]
Hey, waiter! I'm in my soup!
I've been workin' out.
Feel my wing.
Yo!
Two Black Flags over here!
- All right.
- Hair of the dog you bit.
Hey, who ordered
the pu-pu platter?
Here ya go, slick. Enjoy.
Ow! Aah!
Hey, I said no salt!
Pardon me, sir.
I represent a colony of ants,
and I'm looking for tough bugs,
you know, mean bugs--
Fired by a flea--
how humiliating!
Let's face it: We stink.
- You fired!
- You fired!
- Oh, will you shut up?
- You fired!
Someday I will be
a beautiful butterfly,
and then everything
will be better.
I can't believe the troupe is
breaking up. We've always been together.
- Farewell, my friends.
- To the audience we'll never have.
[ Gasps ] Francis! Your boyfriends
from the circus are here!
- [ Gasps ]
- There she is.
- Hello there, girly bug.
- Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.
Say, why don't you
tell our pal, Thud,
- what you said to us at the circus.
- Yeah.
- Somethin' about buzzin'
around a dung heap?
- [ Growls ]
Excuse me. Hi. I represent
an ant colony, and we're--
Hey, bartender!
Bloody Mary, O-positive.
Aha!
- [ Sighs ]
- Sir?
Ladybug, ladybug
fly away home
- [ Laughs ]
- Not so tough now, are you?
All right, clown.
Get up and fight like a girl.
- Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
- I want to be Little John!
- What part can I play?
- You see, I'm looking for
tough, warrior bugs.
Stand back, ye flies! We are
the greatest warriors in all bugdom!
- Warrior bugs!
- My sword!
Swish, swish. Clang, clang.
- Little John?
- What ho, Robin?
Justice is my sword
and truth shall be my quiver!
Wait, wait! No, no!
I want to watch this!
-Jawohl!
- Thrust, parry, lunge!
- [ Growls ]
- Me thinketh it's not working!
[ Gasps ]
Back to Sherwood Forest!
- Schnell! Schnell!
- What's going on in there?
[ All Screaming ]
Help! Help! Get me out!
[ Grunting ]
Wow.
- Oh, ow-ow-ow-ow.
-[ Flik ] You're perfect!
Oh, great ones! I have been scouting
for bugs with your exact talents!
- [ Gasps ] A talent scout.
- My colony's in trouble.
Grasshoppers are coming! We've
been forced to prepare all this food.
- Dinner theater!
- Food?
Please!
Will you help us?
- [ Growling ]
- Where are they?
- We'll take the job!
- Really?
- Yes, yes, yes!
You can explain
the details on the way.
Hey!
[ Chattering ]
- Okay, come on, everyone. Break a leg!
- Whoa, you're vicious!
Hold on, Mr. Ant.
Amazing!
This is too good to be true!
[ Laughs ]
Ooh!
So, you see, it was my fault
that Hopper's coming back.
But then, Princess Atta--
boy, is she one in a million--
she let me go out and find you.
And after seeing you
fight off those flies--
Boy, are those grasshoppers
in for a surprise!
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Chattering In
Foreign Language ]
[ Grunts ]
[ Moans ]
- Dr. Flora!
- Oh, dear. Not another one.
- This is insane.
- Insane.
There's just not enough
food left on the island!
No way we can make double quota
before Hopper comes.
Well, we have to try, Thorny.
We don't have any choice.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, look who's playing
lookout again--little Speck!
- The name is Dot.
- Well, Spot, still lookin' for Flik?
Forget it, Dot.
That loser's never coming back.
Flik!
He did it! He did it!
What? Quit shoving!
This is it!
This is Ant Island!
Flik! Over here!
Flik! Flik!
- Hey!
- He did it! He did it! Yea!
- He did it!
- Cool! [ Screams ]
At the rate these leaves are dropping,
we're gonna need a miracle.
That's right!
We need a miracle!
- Run for your lives!
- [ Anxious Chattering ]
Ta-da!
[ Bird Cawing ]
[ Sighing ] Once again,
our reputation precedes us.
Hey, everybody!
Hey! I'm back!
Hey, guys! Hey-ey!
Look-look-look who's here with me!
Flik! Flik! Flik! You're back!
I knew you could do it!
- Flik?
- It's Flik!
[ Chattering ]
- Flik has returned!
- He's back?
And he's accompanied
by savage insects!
What? How? He wasn't supposed
to actually find someone!
Oh, look at this.
This is great. Look.
- Oh, my ticker!
- So, what are you supposed to be?
He's a stick, stupid.
You hit bugs with him.
- Well, that's an oversimplification.
- That's right, kids. Like this!
- No! Put me down!
- Ow!
- Hey!
- My, you just pop
right open there, dontcha?
- Ooh! Wow!
- Uh-oh. Kids, He's kinda ticklish.
- [ Laughing ]
- Let's come on out. Careful.
[ Laughs ]
Well, my boy, you came through.
- Aphie and I are very impressed.
- [ Aphie Barks ]
Princess Atta! Hey, guys, Princess Atta!
She's the one that sent me to find you!
- Did you see that
really big bug over there?
- He looks absolutely ferocious!
- They're our ticket out of this mess!
- They came just in time!
So, Princess Atta,
what do you think?
No-no-no, wait!
This was not supposed to happen.
Mayday, Mayday.
We're losin' the job.
We don't fight grasshoppers.
- We don't, but they will.
- Bingo!
We gotta sweeten the deal.
Your Majesty,
ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls of all ages,
our troupe here guarantees
a performance like no other!
Why, when your grasshopper friends
get here, we are gonna...
knock them dead!
[ Cheering ]
Boy, these folks are sure
hard up for entertainment.
Come on, come on. Hurry!
[ Panting ]
Wow!
[ Lively Dance Beat ]
Honey, relax.
You should be proud of yourself.
- Your instincts on that boy
were right on the money.
- [ Chuckles ]
[ Music Ends ]
And to make our official
welcome complete-- Mr. Soil?
- Yes, Your Highness?
- He's our resident thespian.
Last year he played the lead
in Picnic. [ Laughs ]
The children-- and myself--
have quickly put together...
a little presentation
in honor of our guests.
Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?
Oh, aren't they adorable!
Ooh, they're cute!
The South Tunnel Elementary School
second grade class...
would like to present you with this,
a mural we have drawn...
of you bugs helping us
fight the grasshoppers away.
Oh, look at the beautiful colors
of the blood.
We drew one of you dying because our
teacher said it would be more dramatic.
- [ Gasps ]
-[ Ants Applauding ]
- [ Playing Harp ]
- I tell you a tale of heroes so bold,
who vanquished our
grasshopper enemies of old.
Look, the last leaf has fallen.
[ Together] We are the grasshoppers!
Where's our food?
Who will come
to save us poor ants?
We are the warriors,
here to defend you!
I die! Die! Die!
[ Cheering ]
- [ Chattering ]
- Thank you, thank you! Oh, thank you!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I say we go.
- Okay, honey. You're up.
- Oh. Um--
- Oh, oh, I-I--
- We're all very grateful to have...
- Here, here.
- [ Amplified ] the warriors--
Thanks.
[ Clears Throat ]
- I'd like to thank the warriors
for helping us in our fight...
- [ Arguing ]
against the grasshoppers.
Secondly, I would like
to thank Flik...
- for his forthright thinking--
- Thank you, Your Highness.
Oh, sure, I'd like to take credit for
all of this, but that wouldn't be right.
Because it was you, Princess Atta.
You believed in me--
- Tell that ant that we need
to talk to him right now.
- Okay, okay.
I know I've made mistakes in the past,
and I hope that this will make up--
- Flik!
- Not right now, Rosie.
I'm making a speech.
[ Grumbles, Whispers ]
Now, I truly believe these bugs
are the answer to our--
No, there's no circus around here.
So, I-- [ Gasps ]
[ Whimpers ]
Your Highness, the warriors
have called for a secret meeting
to plan for a circus--
circumventing the oncoming hordes so
they can trapeze-- trap them with ease!
- Shouldn't I come too?
- No! [ Laughs Nervously ]
No, classified in the D.M.Z.
Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know,
strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye!
Sorry. Sorry I have to take
the warriors away so early,
but you know they have a lot to get
done, with the battle looming and all.
So, uh, please,
everyone enjoy the party.
" B.Y.O.B."?
Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.
Okay, just--
just get in there. Go!
Go! Go, go, go!
Circus bugs?
How can you be circus bugs?
- What?
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You said nothin' about killin'
grasshoppers. You lied to us!
-Ja!
Are you kidding?
Do you know what this is?
This, my friends,
is false advertising.
How dare you! You, sir,
are the charlatan in this scenario--
touting your wares
as a talent scout,
preying upon the hungry souls
of hapless artistes.
Good day to you, sir.
Wait! No, no!
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go.
You have got to help me. Give me
some time, I'll come up with a plan.
-Just go tell them the truth!
- They can't know the truth.
The truth, you see, is bad.
I will be branded for life.
My children's children will
walk down the street,
people will point and say, " Look! There
goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!"
Oh-- oh, you know, all right, fine.
Yeah, okay. Just go.
But if you could just do me
a little favor before you leave.
If you could squish me,
that would be great, because, uh,
when they find out,
I'm as good as dead.
-[ Princess Atta ] Flik!
- [ Gasps ]
I really do think I should be
part of this meeting. Flik!
Aah! Princess Atta!
What a nice... surprise.
Just what exactly is going on?
I would like to speak
with the so-called " warriors."
You can't! They are in the middle
of a top secret meeting right now,
and they really should not
be disturbed... now.
Right, guys?
[ Gasps ] Could you ex-- pl--
Could you excuse me, please?
- Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go!
- I'm not going anywhere.
What is going on? Flik?
Flik! [ Groans ]
Ooh, I knew it!
[ Flik In Distance ] Wait! Wait,
wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't go!
- No!
- Quick, he's losin' it!
- You can't go! I'm desperate!
- Really? I couldn't tell.
Hmm. Come on, wings.
[ Screams ]
Help!
Mother,
Flik is up to something.
Okay, Flik, time to put ya down.
Get him off me!
He's cutting off the circulation.
- No, no, no, no!
- Let go!
- Please, please, don't go!
- [ Rosie ] Put the stick down.
Flik, I mean it, now.
- Drop the stick.
- [ Screams ] Run!
Boy, he runs fast
for a little guy.
- [ Squawks ]
- Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
[ All Gasp, Scream ]
This way.
- There they are.
- [ Bird Chirping ]
- [ Gasps ] A bird!
- [ Screams ] Flik!
- Look!
- Dot!
- [ Whimpers ]
Flik!
- [ Screaming ]
- Dot!
- My baby!
[ Gasps ]
I gotcha! I gotcha!
I gotcha, I gotcha!
- [ Grunts ]
- Oww!
Oooh.
- I can't see!
- Somebody do something!
- Are they all right?
- Did anyone see?
- What is happening?
- Dot?
- Good heavens, they're in trouble!
- Francis, Francis, Francis,
Francis, Francis, Francis--
- Oh, you guys, I've got an idea!
Here! I've got it!
Please, ma'am, wake up!
Wake up!
[ Screaming ]
- Help! Help!
- Yoo-hoo!
Mr. Early Bird! How about
a nice, tasty worm on a stick?
I'm going to snap.
I'm going to snap.
Nice and juicy, succulent--
[ Flik ]
Let's go!
- There they are!
- Flik! Help!
Okay.
- Flik!
- It's going to be okay, Dot.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Bye-bye, birdie!
Help! I'm stuck!
Pull me down!
Schnell, schnell, schnell!
- The caterpillar's using
himself as live bait!
- How brave!
[ Screaming ]
- [ Screeching ]
- Suck it in, man!
Ow. My leg!
[ All Screaming ]
[ Flik Screaming ]
[ Chirping ]
[ Gasps ] The bird!
Look out for the bird!
- Flik!
- [ Gasps ]
- Up-a, up-a!
- [ Screams ]
[ All Pant ]
-[ Distant Applause ]
- What is that?
That, my friends,
is the sound of applause!
[ Cheering ]
Applause-- I'm in heaven!
[ Sighs ]
Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs
for rescuing our smallest member,
Princess Dot.
And as a tribute to Miss Francis,
we've changed out bandannas!
We voted you
our honorary den mother!
- [ Ants Cheering ]
- What? Great.
- [ Chattering ]
- All right, girls. Let's move
your keisters outta here now.
The patient needs her rest,
you know. Come on.
Excuse, me, Flik.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- Huh? Oh, sure.
- Oww!
Again, thank you all,
very, very much.
- Oh, stop it.
- You're too kind.
- Thank you.
You don't think I've offended
the warriors, do you?
You? No.
Oh, good. Because, you see,
when you first brought them here,
I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.
Ya did?
[ Laughs Nervously ]
Don't tell 'em I said that.
Boy, that's all I'd need,
another royal blunder like that.
- Princess, you're doin' a great job.
- Thanks, you're sweet.
You're wrong, but sweet.
- I know what everyone really thinks.
- I don't follow you.
Everyone-- the whole colony. Nobody
really believes I can do this job.
It's like they're all watching me,
-just, just--
- Waiting for you to screw up.
- Flik, I owe you an apology.
- For what?
Well, I haven't been that nice
to you, and... I'm sorry.
If there's any way I can
make it up to you--
Hey! I know!
How would you like to be the queen's
official aide to the warrior bugs?
- Me?
- Oh, sure. You've got
a great rapport with them,
especially after that rescue--
it was very brave.
- Really? Naw, naw--
- Well, not every bug would face a bird.
- I mean, even Hopper's afraid of 'em.
- Yeah, well, I guess maybe I--
- Say that again?
- I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.
Thank you.
- Hopper's afraid of birds!
- And I don't blame 'im!
Oh, oh, oh,
this is perfect.
We can get rid of Hopper,
and no one has to know that I messed up.
You just keep pretending
you're warriors.
Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not
about to fight grasshoppers, okay?
You'll be gone before the grasshoppers
ever arrive. Here's what we do.
Not another word.
I don't know what you're concocting
in that little ant brain of yours,
but we'll have no part of it.
Excuse me? Could we get
the warriors' autographs?
Autographs? Ja!
- Wow! Great!
- So, you fellas catch the action today?
Oh! The bird went-- [ Whooshes ]
and it just missed you!
- Aren't you sweet?
- And the way you pretended
to be stuck in that crack!
[ Chuckling ]
Oh, that's just all part of the plan.
And then you dive-bombed
into the bush!
- There you go, my boy.
- Wow! Thanks!
" M-M-Maa-jor--"
That's Major Manny, young cadet.
-I outrank everyone here. Remember that.
-Yes, sir!
- Dismissed!
- Wow!
- When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a praying mantis!
- I'm gonna be a stick bug!
Oh, they're all so cool,
I can't pick!
[ Chuckling ] Delightful lads.
You were saying, Flik?
All right.
We are going to build a bird--
a bird that we can operate
from the inside, which would then be--
...hoisted above the anthill
and hidden high in the tree.
Then, right when Hopper
and his gang are below,
we'll launch the bird
and scare off the grasshoppers.
Now it's going to take
everyone's involvement--
...to make this plan
a reality.
I know it's not our tradition
to do things differently,
but if our ancestors were able
to build this anthill,
we can certainly rally together
to build this bird!
[ All Cheering ]
[ Laughing ]
- Perfect!
- Okay, hit your marks!
- Whoa!
- Whee-hee!
- [ Giggles ] Hi, Flik.
- Oh.
[ Snickering ]
[ Chuckles Nervously ]
[ Chattering ]
- I love what you did with your antenna.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, look.
She's a natural mother.
[ Growling ] All right, that's it!
Out! Everybody out!
[ Whimpering ]
Now you're gonna cry, right?
See if I care. Go ahead, cry.
-[ Sobbing ]
- Please, don't cry. Please.
- [ Continue Sobbing ]
- Huh?
- Ta-da!
- [ Cheering ]
- Okay, lower, lower--
- [ Dim Chuckles ]
- You got it. And that's it!
- Whoa!
[ All ]
Up, up, up, up!
Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the
barn, two by two by, there's the yarn.
- Done!
- Ruben Kincaid!
- Hey!
- Good job, guys! Nice work!
Up, down.
Up, down. Up, down.
- Hmm.
- Hmm.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep.
- Huh?
- [ Girls Giggle ]
Whoo-whee! Yahoo!
- Flik, watch out!
- Whoa!
- Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!
- [ Laughs ]
There ya go. Good job, fellas.
Keep up the good work.
Huh?
Okay!
[ Together]
You're fired! [ Laughing ]
[ Ants Cheering ]
Yes!
[ Mariachi Band ]
Whoo-hoo! Look at me!
I'm barefootin'! Whoo-hoo!
Yo, bugito,
dos granitos, pronto!
[ Skier]
You gotta try this, man!
[ Buzzing ]
La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
[ Whimpering ]
[ Buzzing ]
...all the way back there
and it starts to rain, we might
as well be suckin' bug spray.
Ooh, don't even say that!
You know somethin'?
You're makin' a lot of sense.
I mean, why take the risk?
- You should tell Hopper.
- Good idea.
But, you know,
it's really not our place.
You're his brother.
That makes you, like...
the vice president of the gang.
Wow! It kinda does,
doesn't it?
Okay, I'll tell 'im.
I should talk to you guys more often.
- What if Hopper doesn't like it?
- Then the genius'll get smacked
and not us.
Vice President Molt.
[ Laughing ]
Ooh, yeah, that's good.
Oh, that's good.
- Ooh, a little lower. Ahh, lower.
- Hey ya, Hop.
- Go away.
- That's fine.
Then I won't tell ya my idea.
- Good!
- Okay, okay. I'll tell ya anyway.
I've been thinkin'-- which is somethin'
I do, bein' vice president and all.
This is a thought, and it was mine:
Why go back to Ant Island at all?
- You don't even like grain.
- What?
You're right. I didn't think
it was such a good idea myself.
It wasn't even my idea.
It was Axle and Loco's!
They talked fancy to me.
I got confused!
- [ Grumbles ]
- La cucaracha, la cucaracha
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
[ Music Stops ]
Guys, order another round...
because we're stayin' here!
- [ Cheering ]
- Yeah!
What was I thinking?
Going back to Ant Island.
I mean, we just got here,
and we have more than enough food
to get us through the winter.
Right? Why go back?
[ Music Resumes ]
But there was that ant
that stood up to me.
- Yeah, but we can forget about him!
- Yeah, it was just one ant.
- [ Mock Scared ] Ooo-oooh!
- One ant!
Yeah, you're right!
It's just one ant!
- Yeah, boss. They're puny!
- Hmm, puny.
Say, let's pretend this grain
is a puny little ant.
- Didn't that hurt?
- Nope.
- Well, how 'bout this one?
- Are you kiddin'?
- [ Laughing ]
- Well, how 'bout this?
[ Screaming ]
You let one ant stand up to us,
then they all might stand up.
Those puny little ants
outnumber us a hundred to one.
And if they ever figure that out,
there goes our way of life!
It's not about food.
It's about keeping those ants in line.
That's why we're going back!
Does anybody else wanna stay?
He's quite the motivational
speaker, isn't he?
Let's ride!
[ Caribbean Band ]
-[ Ant ] To the bird!
-[ Ants ] The bird!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Whoo-hoo!
Hey!
- Hey!
- Whoo!
- Get down, roly boys!
- [ Laughing ]
- How low can you go? Sing it now.
- How low can you go
-Do it, Princess. How low can you go
-[ Laughs ]
And that's how my 12th husband died.
[ Laughs ]
So, now I'm a widow. I mean,
I've always been a black widow,
but now I'm a black widow widow.
[ Laughs ]
[ Laughing ]
Whoo!
- Thorny! Any sign of those fiends?
- Lemme check.
No, not yet.
But we'll be ready for 'em.
Blueberries, dismissed!
- [ Giggling ]
- And, uh, quit beatin' the boys up.
Those little raisins
do grow on ya.
Hey, how you guys doin'?
Some party, huh?
Is that grain dip fresh or what?
Okay, I've told everyone you'll be
stationed deep in the command bunker.
Party quiets down,
I sneak you out the back way
and then you're outta here forever.
Dim don't wanna go.
Well, if Dim stays he's gonna
need me here. He's not fully trained.
- I mean, house-trained.
- [ Chuckles ]
I, uh, I kinda promised the Blueberries
I'd teach 'em canasta.
It seems we've been booked
for an extended engagement.
[ Smooching, Laughing ]
Will you look at this colony?
Will you just look at this colony?
I don't even recognize it.
[ Chuckles ]
I feel 70 again!
Work that ab, baby!
[ Laughs ]
And I have you bugs to thank for it.
So-- thank you!
And, uh, thank you
for findin' 'em, Flik.
Me? Oh, ooh--
uh, uh, I'll get it.
I mean, if you don't mind,
I'll just--
- It's all tangled up.
- [ Laughing Nervously ]
- There.
- Ow!
I think I'll go check
on the bird. [ Giggling ]
- Bird's this way.
- [ Laughing Nervously ]
Yeah, the bird's that way.
[ Chuckling ]
She-- What?
[ Gasps ]
Jiminy H. Cricket!
[ Horn Blares ]
They're back!
Get ready, everybody!
Get to your posts!
Battle stations, everyone.
This not a drill.
Come on, everyone. You know your jobs!
Let's go, go, go, go!
- [ Screams ]
- Look out!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.
Steady, girls. That's it.
- Oh, it's P.T.
- P.T.?
Greetings and salutations!
Ooh-boppa-doo and how do you do?
I am the great P.T. Flea!
[ Laughs ]
I'm in need of your assis--
Oh, let's just cut to the chase.
Look, I've been goin'
from anthill to anthill.
I'm lookin' for a bunch of circus
performers. Have you seen 'em?
- [ Crowd Groans ]
- [ Gasps ]
Wait a second.
Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim?
No, no, no. I'm sorry, no, but uh--
[ Continues, Indistinct ]
- [ Rustling, Groaning ]
- [ Whispering ] Be quiet!
Hey!
[ Flik ] You'll probably--
you'll probably want to get goin;
I guess you got a lot of other anthills
to check into, so, bye!
- [ All Gasp ]
- Ah, guys, I've been lookin'
all over for ya!
- Flaming Death is a huge hit!
- P.T! Sh--
- I'm serious. Word of mouth got around.
- P. T.! No!
The next day, there was a line of flies
outside the tent went on forever!
- It must have been a foot long!
-[ Rosie ] P. T., no!
So, I figured it out. You guys burn me
twice a night, I take a day off to heal,
and then we do it
all over again!
We'll be the top circus act
in the business! [ Guffaws ]
You mean, you're not warriors?
Are you kiddin'? These guys are the
lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen.
And they're gonna make me rich!
[ Chortling ]
You mean to tell me that
our entire defensive strategy...
was concocted by clowns?
Hey, hey, hey, hey. We really thought
Flik's idea was gonna work.
[ Crowd Gasps, Groans ]
- Oops.
- Tell me this isn't true.
- No, you don't-- You don't--
- This couldn't have happened
at a more inopportune time!
The last leaf is about to fall!
[ Dr. Flora ] We haven't collected
any food for the grasshoppers!
If Hopper finds out
what we almost did--
Hopper is not going
to find out.
We're going to hide all this,
and pretend it never happened.
You bugs were never here.
So I suggest you all leave.
But the bird!
The-The bird will work.
I never thought I'd see the day
when an ant would put himself...
-before the rest of his colony.
- What?
- The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
- No, no, no! I-I--
You lied, Flik. You lied to her.
You lied to the colony!
You lied to me!
And like an idiot,
I believed you.
But I-I was just afraid that...
if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs--
[ Sighs Deeply ]
- I just wanted to make a difference.
- I want you to leave, Flik.
And this time, don't come back.
[ Crowd Gasps, Murmurs ]
- [ Gasps ]
- [ Whimpers ]
Tough crowd. Yee-haw!
Flik!
[ Thumper ]
Get those bugs!
[ Panting ]
[ Crowd Chattering ]
[ Grunting ]
That's it? But there's got
to be more food on the island!
If we give up any more,
we'll starve.
- Hopper won't accept this!
-[ Roaring ]
[ Roaring Intensifies ]
- [ Whimpering ]
- Mother, it's not enough.
- What do we do?
- I-I don't know.
-[ Roaring Stops ]
- [ Gasping ]
[ Gasping, Swallowing ]
[ Heavy Footsteps ]
[ Gasps ]
[ Growling, Screeching ]
- [ Crowd Gasping ]
- You little termites!
I give you a second chance,
and this is all I get?
- [ Screaming ]
- But Hopper, we ran out of time!
Have you been playing all summer?
You think this is a game?
- No, no, please!
- Well, guess what?
You just lost.
- [ Screeching ]
- Not one ant sleeps...
until we get
every scrap of food...
on this island!
Just do what he says. You don't
want to make him mad. Believe me!
No, no, no.
You're staying with me, Your Highness.
- [ Screaming ]
- What do you think you're doing?
- Get over there.
- Quick! To the clubhouse.
- [ Rustling ]
- [ Gasping ] Hurry!
- Shh!
- [ Grasshopper ]
Shut up a minute, will ya?
- I think I heard something over here.
- Have you checked over there?
- No, not yet.
- Then get over there and check it out!
- Wait a minute.
- [ Gasps ]
- Hey, I think I found something.
- [ Footsteps Approaching ]
[ Laughs ]
Cool. Hey, how do I look?
Like an idiot.
Oh, I don't know, maybe
it'll keep me dry in the rain.
You moron, we'll be out of here
before it rains.
Didn't you hear Hopper?
After the ants pick all the food,
he's gonna squish the queen
to remind 'em who's boss.
Then she's dead. They cry--boo-hoo--
we go home. End of story.
Oh! Cool. I love our job.
Stay here.
I'm gonna get help.

I'm gonna be rich, rich, rich
I'm gonna be the richest flea
in the land
Ka-ching! The streets'll
be paved with golden retrievers
I'm rich, rich, rich
That's who I am
[ P. T. Continues Singing,
Indistinct ]
- Poor fellow.
- Hey, maybe we can cheer him up a bit.
Don't worry, Flik.
The circus life isn't so bad.
- Yes, you can be part of our act.
- Here! Like this.
Oof! Ahh.
Slapstick! Get it?
I-I'm a walking stick.
[ Laughs Weakly ] Oh, never mind.
-[ Dot ] Flik!
- Dot?
Flik, wait! Wait!
Dot, you're flying!
What are you doing here?
[ Panting ]
You... have to go back.
Hopper moved into the anthill,
and his gang's eating everything!
- Oh, no!
- Good heavens!
And I heard a grasshopper say
that when they're finished,
Hopper's gonna squish my mom!
- Oh, not the queen!
- Do something!
- How?
- [ Rosie ] Come on, you guys, think!
- I know. The bird.
- Yes, of course.
- The bird! That's brilliant.
-Ja!
- The bird won't work.
- What are you talking about?
It was your idea.
- But you said that everything--
Forget everything I ever told you.
All right, Dot?
Let's face it. The colony is right.
I just make things worse.
That bird is a guaranteed failure.
[ Sighs ]
Just like me.
You listen to me, my boy. I've made
a living out of being a failure.
And you, sir, are not a failure!
- Oh, but Flik, you've
done so many good things.
- Oh, yeah?
Okay, show me one thing
I've done right.
- Umm--
- Us.
-[ Bugs ] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- Dim is right, my boy.
You have rekindled the long-dormant
embers of purpose in our lives.
And if it wasn't for you,
Francis would have never gotten
in touch with his feminine side.
Oh yeah? Well-- Hmm.
[ Chuckles ]
You know what? He's right.
Lieutenant Gypsy
reporting for duty.
- Kid, say the word
and we'll follow you into battle.
- We believe in you, my boy.
Flik, please?
Pretend it's a seed, okay?
[ Chuckles ]
Thanks, Dot.
- Hey, what's with the rock?
- Must be an ant thing.
All right, let's do it.
- [ Laughing, Cheering ]
- That's the Flik we know and love.
- We're on!
- So, what do we do first?
Bugs will pay
big bucks to see
A bonfire that is starring me
[ Laughing ]
P.T., look. Money!
[ P. T.]
Where? Where? [ Screaming ]
All right. Get movin'! Get goin'.
Move your abdomens, now!
[ Flik ]
They're rounding everyone up.
- [ Gasps ]
- Hey! Turn your butt off.
Psst! Hey, guys!
Get me out of this thing, will ya?
I promise to start thinkin'
about payin' ya.
Hey! Wait, wait!
Okay, I'll pay ya! I'll pay ya!
[ Flik ] Oh, no!
They've finished collecting the food.
We've got to get the queen now.
Once she's safe,
we move on Gypsy's signal.
-[ Rattling ]
- [ Gasps ] Someone's coming!
[ Rattling Continues ]
Hello, kids! Ready to make
some grasshoppers cry?
It's payback time,

- I think I'm going to wet myself.
- Steady--
- What's going on here?
- Well, uh--
Uh, yes.
[ Chuckling ]
We were invited
by Princess Atta...
as a surprise for your arrival.
- Squish 'em.

for once, Princess.

-Hi-ya!
Hey!

Baby wants pie!
Pie? He asked for it.
Should I give it to him?
Yeah! Give 'em pie!
Give 'em pie!
- [ All Cheering ]
- Yeah! Hah!
Thank you, gentlemen.
Always an intellectual treat.
Say, how many roaches does it take
to screw in a light bulb?
Can't tell. As soon as
the light goes on, they scatter!
[ Hysterical Laughing Continues ]

- I shall select the perfect volunteer.
Ooh, no! Come on,
I'm askin' ya with my brain.
- [ Moaning ] Aha! Why, Your Majesty!
- Me?
- [ Snarling ]
- No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go.
Maybe he'll saw her in half.
[ Snickering ]
As you ascend the dung beetle
to the unknown,
put your trust in the mysteries that
are beyond mere mortal comprehension.
Ooh, this is gonna be good!
- Blueberries ready?
- [ All ] Ready.
- [ Amplified Voice ] Ready!
- Shh!
I call upon the ancient
Szechwan spirits...
to inhabit the body
of our volunteer!
No, no.
Just stay in there, Your Majesty.

Wow.

- [ Gasps ] Not now.
- If it rains, that bird'll
get ripped to shreds!

[ All ]
Ooh!
- Ooh!
- Ooh, pretty!
-[ Applauding ]
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.
- That's the signal. That's the signal!
[ Grunts ]
This is it, girls.
Get ready to roll.
- Huh? It's stuck!
- That was amazing!
I have no-- How did they do that?
I have no idea where she went.
- Thank you. Thank you, thank you.
-[ Audience ] More, more, more!
Wait!
- Where is she?
- Well, now, uh, actually--
I am sorry. A magician
never reveals his secrets.
That's very true, Hoppy. Where would the
mystery be if we all knew how it was--
- Shutting up.
- [ Grunting ]
- You can do it!
You've got to make it work!
- Hey!
I said, where is she?
- [ Whimpering ]
- Ohh!
[ Grunting ]
[ Screaming ]
Hold on!
[ Amplified Cawing ]
[ Screaming ]
Bird! It's a bird!
[ All Yelling ]

- Let's get out of here! Go!
Don't let it get me!
Don't let it get me!
Help me! Aaah!
[ Cackling ]
[ Dot ]
Up, down, up, down.
- And turn!
- [ Grunting ]
[ Screaming ]
- Oh, my eye! Help me!
- [ Screaming ]

Mmm, boysenberry.
Huh?
Aah, no, no, no, no, no!
[ Grunting ]
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Moaning ] Oh, the pain!
There goes my magic act!
- Flaming gas!
- No! P.T!

- [ Screaming ]
- Run!
- [ Gasps ]
- Flik! Help us!
[ Snarls ]

[ Flik ]
Okay! Everyone out! Hurry!
[ Coughing ]
Where's Dot?
Anyone seen Dot?
- [ Screaming ]
- Whose idea was this?
Huh?
Was it yours, Princess?
Just get behind me, girls.
It'll be okay.
[ Flik ]
Leave her alone, Hopper.
The bird was my idea.
I'm the one you want.

[ Blows Landing,

- Ohh.
- [ Grunting ]
- [ Shrieking ]
- [ Snapping ]
[ Growling ]
Where do you get the gall
to do this to me?
[ Panting ] You were--
You were gonna squish the queen.
- [ All Gasping ]
- It's true.
I hate it when someone
gives away the ending.
- [ Roaring ]
- [ Moaning ]
You piece of dirt!
No, I'm wrong.
You're lower than dirt.
You're an ant!
Let this be a lesson
to all you ants.
Ideas are very dangerous things.
You are mindless,
soil-shoving losers,
put on this earth to serve us!
[ Flik ]
You're wrong, Hopper.
[ Groaning ]
[ Inhaling Deeply ] Ants are not meant
to serve grasshoppers!
I've seen these ants
do great things.
And year after year,
they somehow manage...
to pick food
for themselves and you.
So-So who is the weaker species?
Ants don't serve grasshoppers.
It's you who need us.
[ Crowd Gasping, Chattering ]
We're a lot stronger
than you say we are.
And you know it, don't you?
[ Grunts ]
[ Chuckles ]
Well, Princess!
Umm, Hopper?
I hate to interrupt, but, um--
You ants stay back!
- Oh, this was such a bad idea!
- You see, Hopper,
nature has a certain order.
The ants pick the food,
the ants keep the food,
and the grasshoppers leave!
[ Yelling ]
- I'm so proud of you, Flik!
- Charge-a!
Where are you going?
They're just ants!
Oof!
- [ Screams ]
- [ Snarls ]
No! Bad grasshopper!
Bad grasshopper! Go home!
- [ Roaring ]
- [ Roaring Louder]
[ Whining, Yelping ]

[ Hopper ] Come back here,
you cowards! Don't leave!

Happy landings, Hopper!

- Come on!
[ Screaming ]
[ Flik ]
There!
[ Atta Grunts ]
Come on!
We've gotta hide!
No matter what happens,
stay down!
Flik, no!
What are you doing?
- Uh-- Hopper!
- You think it's over?
No, no, no.
No, I-I can explain.
- All your little stunt did
was buy them time!
- No, please!
Please, Hopper!
I'll get more grasshoppers
and be back next season,
but you won't!
[ Chirping ]
- [ Choking ]
- Well, what's this?
Another one of
your little bird tricks?
- Yup.
- Are there a bunch of little
girls in this one too?
- Hello, girls!
- [ Screeching ]
[ Screaming In Terror]
No! No!
No, no, no, no!
No! Aah!
[ Screaming ] No!
Oh, no!
Oh, no! No, no, no!
[ Screams ]
[ Horn Blowing ]
Come on, boys!
- Hey, Princess Dot! Wait up!
- [ Giggling ]
[ Sighs ]
I finally get a second to relax,
and I gotta get out of my chair.
- Come on! You can rub lotion
on me later, shade boy.
- Yeah, hubba-hubba.
[ Both Laughing ]
- [ Laughing, Chattering ]
- [ Heimlich ] Oh, thank you!
- Oh, you're too kind!
- It was the least we could do.
All in a day's work.
Dim!
- Ohh!
- [ Kids ] Ohh!
I'm so sorry, kids.
I wish you could come along too.
- [ Kids Weeping ]
- I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.
[ Chattering ]
[ Chattering ]
[ Laughing ]
Hey, let's go. We got a schedule
to keep. Come on, let's go.
- Hup, hup, hey!
- Hey, Tiny!
Let's get this show packed up!
We got paying customers hatching!
Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir.
Of course, sir. Right away, sir.
And, um, I just wanted to
thank you for giving me a chance,
because it's an honor to work
with creative giants such as yourself.
- Shutting up.
- You sure you can't
come on tour with us?
- Sorry. My place is here.
- Good answer.
Oh, well. Your loss.
One minute, insects!
I wanna thank all of you...
for giving us back our hope,
our dignity, and our lives.
And to you, Princess Atta.
You have given us so much.
Please accept this gift
from us bugs...
to you ants.
- For you!
- Oh! It's a rock.
- [ Chuckling ]
- What's with the rock?
Must be a circus thing.
[ Giggling ]
Well, Flik, you really goofed up.
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you too.
[ Gasps ]
[ Crowd Cheering ]
- [ Giggling ]
- [ Sniffling ] All right.
Now it's gettin' mushy.
- We're outta here! Hy-aah!
- [ Whip Cracking ]
- Whoa!
- [ Rosie ] See ya next season!
- [ Francis ] See ya, Flik!
- Bye! We miss you already!
- You fired!
- [ Gasps ] We forgot Heimlich!
I'm finished! Finally,
I'm a beautiful butterfly!
[ Grunting ]
Mein wings!
Oh, they're beautiful!
[ Flik ] Heimlich! The wagon's
taking off! You better start flying!
But I am flying! And from way up here,
you all look like little ants!
Auf Wiedersehen!
Bye!
Present stalks!
Harvester, salute!

Hardly there
How he felt, what he dreamed
Who would care
- Without any evidence
- His flaws were many, ooh

BOY: Baba...
MAN: Yes, my son.
BOY: Tell me a story.
MAN: (CHUCKLES) Which one?
The story of home.
Millions of years ago...
a meteorite
made of vibranium...
the strongest substance
in the universe...
struck the continent
of Africa...
affecting the plant life
around it.
And when
the time of man came...
five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.
The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...
until a warrior shaman...
received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...
who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...
a plant that granted him
superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.
The warrior became king...
and the first Black Panther...
the protector of Wakanda.
Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...
but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.
The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...
more advanced
than any other nation.
But as Wakanda thrived...
the world around it descended
further into chaos.
To keep vibranium safe...
the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...
keeping the truth
of their power
from the outside world.
And we still hide, Baba?
Yes.
BOY: Why?
(IN THE TRUNK
BY TOO $HORT PLAYING)
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!
Whatever!
Get outta here!
Check up.
Pick your man up! He open.
Where you at?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.
Pass! Pass!
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!
Watch me get this.
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.
KID: Come on.
BOY: What you got?
You ain't got nothing.
MAN: Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,
won't be no worries.
You in the van,
come in through from the west.
Come around the corner.
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...
(FAINT RUSTLING)
Hide the straps.
Yo, is it the Feds?
No.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.
They're holding spears.
Open it.
JAMES: You serious?
They won't knock again.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Prove to me you are one of us.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
My King.
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.
As you wish.
At ease.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Come, baby brother.
how you are holding up.
You look strong.
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.
How is home?
Not so good.
(IN XHOSA) Baby brother.
There has been an attack.
This man...
Ulysses Klaue...
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.
Many lives were lost.
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...
and how to strike.
He had someone on the inside.
Why are you here?
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.
I did no such thing.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Tell him who you are.
Zuri, son of Badu...
What?
James. James, you lied to me?
Leave him.
You were Wakandan
this whole time?
You betrayed Wakanda!
How could you lie
to me like...
Stand down.
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?
Prince N'Jobu...
you will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
Check up!
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Guard your man,
guard your man!
Yo.
REPORTER:
The tiny nation of Wakanda
is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.
The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...
after a terrorist attack
at the United Nations
a week ago.
The suspect
has since been apprehended.
Though it remains one of
the poorest countries
in the world...
fortified by
mountain ranges...
and an impenetrable
rainforest...
Wakanda does not engage
in international trade
or accept aid.
The succession
of the throne...
is expected to fall
to the oldest
of the king's two children...
Prince T'Challa.
OKOYE: My Prince...
coming up on them now.
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.
Hmm.
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.
Just don't freeze
when you see her.
What are you talking about?
I never freeze.
(MEN GRUNTING)
MILITANT 1: What's going on?
MILITANT 2: It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.
The car no start.
MILITANT 3: What happened?
MILITANT 4: The engine failed.
MILITANT 1: Ours, too.
What is it, Captain?
- Defense positions.
- (GUNS COCKING)
Defense positions.
MILITANT 2:
Are we under attack?
Defense positions.
Get around to the side.
Defense positions.
Hey. Defense positions!
No games.
(BARKING)
What do you see?
(WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
- Come in. Come in.
- (SCREAMS)
Over there! Look back!
Watch out!
(ALL SCREAMING AND GRUNTING)
NAKIA: T'Challa, no!
This one's just a boy.
He got kidnapped as well.
BLACK PANTHER: Nakia...
I...
- I wanted...
- MILITANT 1: Hey!
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!
I will shoot her right now.
(GROANS)
You froze.
BLACK PANTHER: Ah...
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.
My father is dead, Nakia.
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.
And I wish for you
to be there.
NAKIA:
Carry yourselves home now.
WOMAN: Thank you.
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.
Thank you oh.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
You will speak
nothing of this day.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.

OKOYE: Sister Nakia...
My Prince...
we are home.
This never gets old.

Queen Mother...
Princess...
My comfort for your loss.
RAMONDA: Thank you, Nakia.
It is so good
to have you back with us.
Take her to
the River Province
to prepare her
for the ceremony.
Yes, General.
Did he freeze?
Like an antelope
in headlights.
(LAUGHING)
Are you finished?
So surprised
my little sister came
to see me off
before our big day.
You wish!
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.
How many times
do I have to teach you?
Just because something works
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.
You are teaching me?
What do you know?
SHURI: More than you.
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...
to your ceremonial outfit.
Shuri!
Sorry, Mother!
How are you
feeling today, Mama?
Proud.
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.
He is with us...
and it is your time
to be king.
Good morning.
How can I help you?
I was just checking out
these artifacts.
They tell me
you're the expert.
Ah. You could say that.
They're beautiful.
Where's this one from?
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...
present day Ghana...
19th century.
For real?
What about this one?
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...
16th century.
Now, tell me about this one.
Also from Benin,
seventh century.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Fula tribe, I believe.
Nah.
I beg your pardon?
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin
but it's from Wakanda.
And it's made
out of vibranium.
(CHUCKLES) Don't trip.
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.
These items aren't for sale.
How do you think
your ancestors got these?
You think they paid
a fair price?
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?
Sir, I'm going to have to
(CLEARS THROAT)
ask you to leave.
You got
all this security in here
watching me
ever since I walked in.
- (CLEARS THROAT)
- But you ain't checking for
- what you put in your body.
- (GASPS)
All right, mate.
Let's have it.
- Come on, mate. Time.
- (GRUNTS)
I think she might not
be feeling too good.
Somebody get some help!
Come here!
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!
GUARD: Medical emergency
right away
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.
Look out.
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.
I'm gonna take a break.
MEDIC 1: Let's give the lady
some space, please.
MEDIC 2: Step back,
please, gents.
Step back, please.
(GUARDS GRUNT)
Hey, come here.
Come here. It's okay.
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?
Because it's better to leave
the crime scene
more spread out.
Makes us look like amateurs.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Now then,
let's see if you know
what you're talking about.
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
That's just a taste.
(SNIFFING)
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.
(CHUCKLES) It's already sold!
Whatever you try,
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.
That'll make my day.
I can kill two birds
with one stone.
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

We have watched

Who scoffs at tradition!
And now you want to
hand the nation

who could not keep
his own father safe.
Mmm?

I am not ready.
Have you not prepared
to be king your whole life?
Have you not trained
and studied,
been by my side?
what I am talking about.
I am not ready
to be without you.
A man who has not prepared
his children
for his own death...
has failed as a father.
Have I ever failed you?
Never.
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.
I want to be
a great king, Baba.
Just like you.
You're going to struggle.
So you'll need to
surround yourself
with people you trust.
You're a good man
with a good heart.
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.
(GASPING)

T'Challa, breathe.
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

He was there. My father.

Just one?
Come home, Nakia.
I'm right here.
Stay.
I came to support you
and to honor your father...
but I can't stay.
I found my calling out there.
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.
I can't be happy here...
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?
Share what we have.
We could provide aid...
and access to technology
and refuge
to those who need it.
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.
If the world found out
what we truly are...
what we possess...
we could lose our way of life.
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.
T'CHALLA: Is that him?
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?
W'KABI: Of course.
I see Nakia is back.
You guys going to work it out?
T'Challa...
what's wrong?
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.
More, like what?
Foreign aid, refugee programs.
You let the refugees in...
they bring their problems
with them.
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...
to go out there
and clean up the world,
then I'll be all for it.
But waging war
on other countries
has never been our way.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILLING)
You, too, huh?
Bast! We're in trouble.
My King.
My love.
You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...
in South Korea...
tomorrow night.
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.
We need a king.
My parents were killed
when he attacked.
Not a day goes by
when I do not think
about what Klaue took from us.
From me.
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.
W'KABI: Take me with you.
We'll take him down together,
side by side.
I need you here
protecting the border.
Then I ask...
you kill him
where he stands...
or you bring him back to us.
You have my word.
I will bring him back.
We will proceed
with the mission.
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
My King!
- Stop it. Stop it.
- (CHUCKLES)
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?
Okoye.
And Nakia as well.
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?
Yes.
We'll be fine.
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.
Yes!
I have great things
to show you, Brother.
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.
Unlimited range,
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.
Check these out.
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.
T'CHALLA: Ah.
And what are these?
The real question is
(SHOUTS) what are those?
(CHUCKLES)
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.
I bet the Elders loved that.
(CHUCKLES)
Try them on.
Fully automated.
Like the old American movie
Baba used to watch.
T'CHALLA: Mmm.
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.
Interesting.
Guess what I call them.
Sneakers.
Because you...
Never mind.
If you're going to take
on Klaue...
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.
Exhibit A.
T'CHALLA: My design.
SHURI: Old tech.
- Old?
- Functional, but old.
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."
- Enough.
- (CHUCKLES)
Now, look at these.
Do you like that one?
Tempting.
But the idea
is to not be noticed.
This one.
(TRILLING)
Now tell it to go on.
SHURI: Ooh!
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.
Strike it.
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.
Not that hard, genius!
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.
I invite you to my lab,
and you just
kick things around?
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.
Hey.
Wait a minute.
SHURI: The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...
and hold it in place
for redistribution.
Very nice.
Strike it again
in the same spot.
(KIMOYO BEADS BEEP)
You're recording?
For research purposes.
(SHURI LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
Delete that footage.
(HANGOVER BY PSY
AND SNOOP DOGG PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
This way.
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.
What? It's a disgrace.
(IN KOREAN) Hello Sophia.
Good to see you.
Who are these two?
My friends from Kenya.
Very deep pockets.
They're good.
Good for trouble...
...like you?
(EXCLAIMS)
Thank you!
(PRAY FOR ME BY THE WEEKND
AND KENDRICK LAMAR PLAYING)
Spread out.
The buyer
is likely already here.
The woman outside.
What trouble
was she referring to?
Ah... I got into
a disagreement
with some ivory traders.
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.
And will there be
any trouble tonight,
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?
Depends...
on how quickly we finish
the mission.
OKOYE: (ON RADIO)
Can we please focus?
Thank you.
(SPEAKING KOREAN)
Over here.
One whiskey, please.
Eyes up. Americans.
I count three.
OKOYE: Five.
How could you miss
Greased Lightning
there behind you?
Six.
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.
It just got
a little more complicated.
Agent Ross.
Your Highness.
You are buying from Klaue.
What I'm doing or not doing...
on behalf of
the U.S. government
is none of your concern.
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.
I gave you Zemo.
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...
that the king of
a third world country
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?
I'd say we were even.
You really need to leave, now.
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.
You've been warned.
CROUPIER: Three, craps.
Hey, you won!
You know what?
I think
I'll just take these...
bring them over here
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- ROSS: Mmm-hmm.
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.
He cannot leave with Klaue.
All right.
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia
links back to a person...
that I'm not actually saying
I'm here to make
a deal with...
but that deal
will not be called off.
When the dust settles,
you and me can work
something out.
I'm not here to make a deal.
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING
ON CAR STEREO)
(DOOR BUZZING AND BEEPING)
Klaue, plus eight!
General.
In position
to secure our exit.
And the vibranium?
I don't see it yet.
OKOYE: I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.
There's not supposed to be.
Somebody did not get the memo.
Definitely armed.
Well, that is quite
the entourage.
You got a mixtape coming out?
Oh, yeah. (CHUCKLES)
Yeah, actually, there is one.
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.
(CHUCKLES)
You think they're for you?
Don't worry.
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,
thank you very much.
OKOYE: Six more. It's a setup.
You got the diamonds?
Okay. That's enough.
- We need to move on Klaue.
- T'CHALLA: Stand down.
We can't afford a shootout.
Vibranium?
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.
It's now or never.
(IN XHOSA) Stand down!
Hey!
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
(GRUNTING)
(CROWD SCREAMING)
Wakandans! They're here!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
ROSS: Get outta here!
KLAUE: Kill 'em all!
Diamonds, quick!
(ALL GRUNTING)
(YELLS)
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Murderer!
(GUN CLICKING)
You know, you look just like
your old man.
(WEAPON POWERING UP)
(GRUNTS)
I made it rain! (LAUGHS)
Let's get out of here, boss!
That was awesome!
That was awesome!
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!
- Do we just leave him?
- He'll catch up.
(DEVICE BEEPS)
Shuri!
Yes!
AUTOMATED VOICE: Remote
driving system activated.
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?
T'CHALLA: For Bast's sake!
- Just drive!
- Okay, calm down!
Whoo! Let's go!
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?
(UPBEAT RAP MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO)
Which one is he in now?
Hey, split up!
- They're trying to lose us.
- I'll take the right.
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.
(TIRES SCREECH)
We're not going to make it!
BLACK PANTHER: Keep going!
Whoo! Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTS)
Hey, what was that?
BLACK PANTHER: Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.
Guns.
So primitive!
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!
The bullets won't penetrate!
What are you doing?
Just drive.
(MEN YELL)
- Whoo!
- Shit!
Hey, look at your suit.
You've been taking bullets,
charging it up
with kinetic energy.
BLACK PANTHER:
Pull around the truck.
Where'd he go?
You show-off.
There he is!
Hold tight!
(ENGINE REVS)
All right.
Let's have some fun!
(GRUNTING)
(STRAINING)
(PANTING)
Hop in.
Put that spear in the trunk.
BLACK PANTHER: Faster, Shuri.
I'm going as fast as I can!
Take a right! Take a right!
(TIRES SCREECH)
No, no, no!
(GRUNTS) Brother!
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
(GROANING AND PANTING)
BLACK PANTHER: Klaue!
Did you think we would forget?
(BLACK PANTHER GRUNTING)
Look at me, murderer!
Where did you get this weapon?
You savages didn't deserve it.
- (GRUNTS)
- (GROANS)
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.
(IN XHOSA) King!
The world watches.
Let's go, huh?
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)
Yeah.
KLAUE: Hello.
(GIGGLES)
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.
(CACKLING)
(AIR KISSES)
(SPLUTTERING)
So this is a big mess, huh?
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes
than to make a scene here.
After your questioning,
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor
by letting you
even be in here.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
If he touches you again,
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.
Does she speak English?
When she wants to.
Huh.
I'm going in.
When I'm done,
you guys are up.
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.
You see that?
It's called diplomacy.
You're welcome.
(KLAUE SINGS WHAT IS LOVE
BY DEE DEE HALLIGAN
AND JUNIOR TORELLO)
- Okoye.
- (SCOFFS)
Play nice.
Americans.
(KLAUE CONTINUES SINGING)
(ROSS CLEARS THROAT)
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.
I'm much more your speed.
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.
Where'd you get that?
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.
But I can get you one,
if you like.
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,
and I'll ask them.
He's right outside.
Why don't you
ask him yourself?
What? T'Challa?
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?
Bingo.
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?
ROSS: Um...
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.
KLAUE: (ON EARPIECE)
It's all a front.
Explorers searched for it
for centuries.
El Dorado, the Golden City.
They thought they could
find it in South America...
but it was in Africa
the whole time.
A technological marvel.
All because it was built
on a mound
of the most valuable metal
known to man.
Isipho, they call it.
The gift.
Vibranium.
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.
It's not just a metal.
They sew it
into their clothes.
It powers their city,
their tech...
their weapons.
Weapons?
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.
That's a nice fairy tale,
but Wakanda is
a third world country...
and you stole
all their vibranium.
(LAUGHING) I stole...
All of it?
I took a tiny piece of it.
They have
a mountain full of it.
They've been mining it
for thousands of years...
and they still haven't
scratched the surface.
I'm the only outsider
who's seen it
and got out of there alive.
If you don't believe me,
you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.
What his claws are made of.
(BEEPING)
Your father told the UN...
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.
But now he's telling me
you have more.
And you believe the word
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?
(TRUCK BEEPING)
(IN KOREAN) Where is that?
Back there.
How much more are you hiding?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Something is happening
out back.
(YELLS)
Get down!
- (KLAUE YELLING)
- Stand down!
MAN 1: Cover!
MAN 2: Grenade!
I see you took your time,
didn't you? (LAUGHS)
(OKOYE SPEAKING XHOSA)
My King!
My King.
Nakia.
He just jumped in front of me.
(LABORED BREATHING
AND GRUNTING)
I don't think
he'll make it here.
It hit his spine.
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)
This will stabilize him
for now.
(ROSS GRUNTING SOFTLY)
(EXHALING DEEPLY)
Give him to us.
We can save him.
OKOYE: Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.
We failed.
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?
He took a bullet for me.
OKOYE: That was his choice.
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?
Let us consider
that we heal him.
It is his duty to report back
to his country.
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.
I cannot just let him die...
knowing we can save him.
Where exactly
are we taking him?
(UPBEAT AFRICAN MUSIC PLAYING)
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.
This is going to be fun.
He will live.
- (KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
- (MUSIC STOPS)
W'Kabi is here.
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?
He's not here.
(SIGHS)
He slipped through our hands.
"Slipped"?
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.
With you,
I thought it'd be different.
But it's more of the same.
Let's get going, boss.
You always sell to the CIA?
I sell to the highest bidder.
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...
and I lay low for a bit,
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.
I know you good for it.
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.
You don't want to
go there, boy.
Yeah, I do.
KLAUE: Drop it!
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine
ends today.
Put your gun down now!
I'm sorry.
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.
(KLAUE GROANS)
(GROANS)
(KLAUE PANTING)
You really want to go
to Wakanda?
They're savages.
This is what they do
to people like us.
KILLMONGER: I ain't worried
about no brand.
Check these out.
Each one is for a kill.
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.
(CHUCKLING)
T'CHALLA: Leave us!
So your mission did not go
as planned.
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?
My father told me
he disappeared.
There was a man today...
wearing a ring
identical to this one.
That is not possible.
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!
My grandfather's ring!
Do not tell me
what is possible.
Tell me the truth!
Some truths...
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.
That is not your choice
to make.
What happened to him?
I promised the king
to say nothing.
I am your king now!
Your uncle took...
a War Dog assignment
in America.
Your father...
placed me there...
to observe...
unbeknownst to him.
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.
They had a child.
The hardships he saw there...
radicalized your uncle.
I observed
for as long as I could.
Their leaders
have been assassinated.
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.
All over the planet...
our people suffer because
they don't have the tools
to fight back.
With vibranium weapons,
they could overthrow
every country...
and Wakanda could
rule them all
the right way.
He knew your father
would not support this.
So, your uncle betrayed us.
No!
He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.
No, no, no.
You will return home
at once...
where you will face
the Council...
and inform them
of your crimes.
ZURI: He drew his weapon
on me.
- No!
- (GRUNTING)
ZURI: Your father
killed his own brother...
to save my life.
Speak nothing of this.
And the child?
We left him.
We had to...
maintain...
the lie.
What is this?
Just a little gift.
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Who are you?
(DEVICE WHIRRING)
(GRUNTING)
All right, where am I?
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!
(STAMMERS) What?
My name is Everett.
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...
former air force pilot
and now CIA.
Right.
Okay, is this Wakanda?
No, it's Kansas.
How long ago was Korea?
SHURI: Yesterday.
I don't think so.
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
They do here.
But not by magic,
by technology.
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.
ROSS: These train things...
that's magnetic levitation,
right?
Obviously.
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.
The light panels,
what are they?
- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?
In its raw form...
vibranium is too dangerous
to be transported
at that speed...
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.
ROSS: There's vibranium
on those trains?
There's vibranium
all around us.
That's how I healed you.
(CHUCKLES)
Where is T'Challa?
His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.
A man showed up at the border
who claims
to have killed Klaue.
What?
W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.
We need to find your brother!
An outsider?
No, a Wakandan.
He's not a Wakandan.
He's one of ours.
He killed his own brother...
and left a child behind...
with nothing.
What kind of king...
What kind of man does that?
No man is perfect.
Not even your father.
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...
he may have created something
even worse.
Hey.
Look at me.
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.
(KIMOYO BEADS TRILL)
Brother, you need to
get here now!
ROSS: Erik Stevens.
Graduated Annapolis age 19...
MIT for grad school.
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,
like it was a video game.
Started calling him
Killmonger.
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.
They will drop off the grid...
so they can
commit assassinations
and take down governments.
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?
SHURI: He has
a War Dog tattoo...
but we have no record of him.
Is this man Wakandan or not?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
Tell us what is going on.
Speak.
I'm standing in your house...
serving justice to a man
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand
is because I know who you are.
Now, what do you want?
I want the throne.
(LAUGHS AND SPEAKS XHOSA)
My goodness.
(TRIBES' ELDERS LAUGHING)
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.
Must feel good.
It's about two billion people
all over the world
that looks like us.
But their lives
are a lot harder.
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.
And what tools are those?
Vibranium. Your weapons.
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...
for people
who are not our own.
Not your own?
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?
So ain't all people
your people?
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.
And it is my responsibility
to make sure
our people are safe...
and that vibranium
does not fall
into the hands
of a person like you.
KILLMONGER: Mmm...
RAMONDA: Son.
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.
Reject his request.
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.
An American black operative.
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.
That's who you are.
That's not my name, Princess.
Ask me, King.
No.
Ask me.
Take him away.
(IN XHOSA) Who are you?
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.
Son of N'Jobu?
with Panther claws
in his chest!
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.
(IN XHOSA) You're lying!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.
RIVER TRIBE ELDER:
(GASPS) What?
(SPEAKING XHOSA)
The descendent of N'Jobu.
I'm exercising my blood right
to challenge
for the mantles of king...
and Black Panther.
Do not do this, T'Challa.
BORDER TRIBE ELDER:
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,
he is within his rights.
He has no rights here!
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.
Weeks? I don't need weeks.
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?
I accept your challenge.
SHURI:
He'll never beat T'Challa.
He should've just come
to the first challenge
and gotten it over with.
(UPBEAT DRUMMING)
ZURI: The king
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther
stripped away.
(LABORED BREATHING)
Where is Agent Ross?
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.
This is your last chance.
Throw down your weapons,
and we can handle this
another way.
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.
I trained, I lied, I killed...
just to get here.
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...
Iraq.
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters
right here on this continent.
And all this death...
just so I could kill you.
Let the challenge begin.
- (FAST-TEMPO DRUMMING)
- (GRUNTING)
Yield!
(GROANS)
(T'CHALLA GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Snap out of it, T'Challa!
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)
(YELLS)
(GASPS)
(BREATHES HEAVILY)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
Come on, get up.
Come here.
This is for my father.
ZURI: Erik!
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!
I am the cause of
your father's death.
Not him.
Take me.
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.
No!
No! No!
Zuri, no!
(GROANS)
No!
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!
No! No!
(YELLING)
Is this your king? Huh?
(T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
Is this your king?
The Black Panther,
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?
Come on, Brother!
Is there nothing
that can be done?
- (T'CHALLA GRUNTING)
- Him?
He's supposed to protect you?
- No.
- No!
No!
Nah. I'm your king.
- No! No!
- We have to go now!
Queen Mother, let's go!
(RAMONDA CRYING)
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?
- Yes.
- (SIGHS)
(IN XHOSA) Thank you.
to them immediately.
(IN XHOSA) I cannot.
Though my heart is with you.
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man
who showed up here
only hours ago.
He is of royal blood.
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.
Does that really matter?
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.
Overthrow?
Nakia!
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.
What are you loyal to?
I loved him.
I loved my country, too.
Then you serve your country.
No. I save my country.
What's wrong?
The king is dead.
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.
First Baba.
And now my brother.
(CRYING) Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.
(RAMONDA SIGHS)
- (WHISPERS) It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.
Where's Okoye?
Okoye is not coming.
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.
Wait here.
What has happened
to our Wakanda?
(CHANTING SOFTLY)
SHAMAN:
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.
(SOBBING QUIETLY)
N'JOBU: What did I tell you
about going into my things?
Hmm?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
What did you find?
Your home.
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.
Yes. The sunsets there
are the most beautiful
in the world.
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.
Why?
They will say you are lost.
But I'm right here.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
No tears for me?
Everybody dies.
It's just life around here.
Well, look at what
I have done.
I should've taken you back
long ago.
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.
That's why they can't find us.
(GASPING)
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?
This all of it?
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,
we will be ready.
Another king?
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...
(CHOKING)
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.
(YELPS)
(BOTH GASP)
Burn it all!
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
You know, where I'm from...
when black folks
started revolutions,
they never had
the firepower...
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.
Where was Wakanda?
Hmm?
Yeah, all that ends today.
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.
Already in place.
I know how colonizers think.
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.
And their children.
And anyone else
who takes their side.
It's time they know
the truth about us!
We're warriors!
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.
OKOYE: Wakanda has survived
for so long...
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.
But the world is changing,
General.
Elders, it is getting smaller.
The outside world
is catching up...
and soon it will be
the conquerors
or the conquered.
I'd rather be the former.
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.
ROSS: So where are we
going again?
NAKIA: We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb
to Jabariland.
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.
Nakia.
I don't like this.
The Herb belongs to us.
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.
I am a spy with no army.
I wouldn't stand a chance.
(SIGHS)
We'll go.
Oh, boy.
(SHUSHES)
(MEN CHANTING AND GRUNTING)
ROSS: Oh, shit.
Look down. Stay calm.
Shuri.
Look down.
My son...
was murdered in ritual combat.
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...
(GRUNTS)
- The new king...
- (MEN GRUNTING)
M'BAKU: You cannot talk!
One more word,
and I will feed you
to my children.
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.
(LAUGHING)
NAKIA: Great Gorilla M'Baku...
this is why we are here.
To offer this to you.
An outsider
sits on our throne.
Only you can help us stop him.
Come with me.
- (GASPS)
- Impossible!
(RAMONDA GASPING)
Is he breathing?
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.
One of our fishermen found him
at the edge
of the river border.
He brought him to me.
Why do you have him
in the snow?
It is the only thing
keeping him
from joining the ancestors.
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.
Nakia, the Herb.
I call upon the ancestors.
I call upon Bast.
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.
Heal him.
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!
Okay.
(IN XHOSA)
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Praise the ancestors.
Wake up, T'Challa.
Wake up.
(T'CHAKA SPEAKS XHOSA)
My son.
for you to come home...
and be reunited with me.
(SPEAKS XHOSA)
Why?
bring the boy home?
Why, Baba?
He...
He was the truth
I chose to omit.
You were wrong to abandon him.
I chose my people.
I chose Wakanda.
Our future depended...
You were wrong!
All of you were wrong!
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!
We let the fear
of our discovery
stop us from doing
what is right!
No more!
I cannot stay here with you.
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.
He is a monster
of our own making.
I must take the mantle back.
I must!
I must right these wrongs.
- (T'CHALLA GASPS)
- (RAMONDA EXCLAIMING)
(SHIVERING)
Do you have a blanket?
NAKIA: Killmonger
has the full support
of our military.
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.
ROSS: Of course he did.
That's what he was
trained to do.
His unit used to work
with the CIA
to destabilize
foreign countries.
They would always strike
at transitions of power...
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.
You get control of government,
the military...
- Our resources.
- ROSS: Right.
The Great Mound.
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.
He will send our weapons
all over the world.
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.
- What?
- What about you?
The challenge
will have to continue.
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.
It is my duty
to keep you safe.
If he gets control
of our technology,
nowhere will be safe.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
The Black Panther lives.
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...
I will be right there
beside him.
As will I.
ROSS: I'm in, too.
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.
(M'BAKU YAWNS LOUDLY)
Are you done?
(STAMMERS) Are you done?
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?
(SIGHS)
Thank you.
I owed you a great debt.
A life for a life.
Consider it paid.
Please allow my mother
to stay here.
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.
You know, I could use
an army as well.
I bet you could. (LAUGHS)
But no.
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.
It is our cause.
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...
and now you speak of "us"?
I cannot speak for past kings.
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.
We both know the power
of vibranium.
If Killmonger
gains control of it,
who do you think
he will come for next?
We will not help you.
(SIGHS)
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
W'KABI:
Everything is on schedule.
Have the spies been alerted?
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.
But the War Dogs in London,
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.
We'll strike there first.
The others'll come around.
Look at this.
A handheld sonic cannon,
powerful enough
to stop a tank...
untraceable by
metal detectors.
And we got thousands of them.
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.
(EXPLOSION)
He lives.
N'Jadaka!
Wassup?
I never yielded!
And as you can see,
I am not dead!
All that challenge shit
is over with!
I'm the king now!
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!
- Shuri, now.
- SHURI: (ON RADIO) Copy that.
SHURI: Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.
What will we do?

of the Royal Talon with this.
So what do I do?
You'll have to fly it.
- What?
- You were a great pilot.
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?
Hey, Nakia, take that.
- I'm not a Dora.
- Just put it on, it's armor!
Come!
Good luck, Agent Ross!

Neither will he.
Okay!

I don't need a suit
to kill you.
Your reign is over!
You sat up here,
safe and protected.
T'CHALLA: You want to
see us become
just like the people
you hate so much.
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.
You have become them!
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!
The world took
everything away from me!
Everything I ever loved!
But I'mma make sure
we're even.
I'mma track down

And for the first time

Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.
We cannot.
We must not.
We will work to be an example
of how we...
as brothers and sisters
on this earth...
should treat each other.
Now, more than ever...
the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.
We all know the truth.
More connects us
than separates us.
But in times of crisis...
the wise build bridges...
while the foolish
build barriers.
We must find a way...
to look after one another...
as if we were one,
single tribe.

NARRATOR :
1936, Jesse Owens.
1960, Cassius Clay.
And now in 1988,
the name on everyone's lips,
US table tennis champion,
Randy Daytona.
You've seen him
in Sports Illustrated, on
the Cinnamon Toast Crunch box.
You may even already own
his McDonald's
collector's glass.
NEWS REPORTER :
The golden boy
who iced Iceland in round one,
and checked off Czechoslovakia
in round two.
So why don't
we take a moment to meet
the real Randy Daytona?
Here he is showing us
his skills with
his lucky Def Leppard paddle
that's won him
over 200 amateur matches.
With him, as always, his coach
and father, Sergeant Pete
Daytona, of the US Marines.
Randy,
you're only 12 years old,
and already they're saying
that your name
will go down among those
of the greatest
Ping-Pong players
ever to take up the sport.
And right offhand,
I don't know
what those names are.
Randy,
the eyes of all America,
and indeed the entire world,
will be on you tonight.
(FANS CHEERING)
USA! USA! USA!
2.:45 am. The moment
you've all been waiting for.
The men's table tennis

Tiny balls, bouncing for gold.
(CROWD CHEERING)
USA! USA! USA!
Now, presenting
the United States of America,
Randy Daytona!
ANNOUNCER :
Here he is,
entering to his unofficial
theme song, Rock of Ages,
by the super group
Def Leppard.
I love you, Randy!
Hey, big guy,
I just want to make sure
you're ready.
Have you seen my dad?
No.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Where were you?
You think I'd miss this?
You didn't put money on this,
did you?
Dad, you promised.
Try not to think about it,
okay?
Now, presenting East Germany,
Karl Wolfschtagg!
Deutschland! Deutschland!
Deutschland! Deutschland!
May the best man win, huh?
I will destroy him!
Beat that Kraut!

Breathtaking intensity
surrounds the table
as Daytona and Manslaughter
fire away at each other.
Daytona's in the groove.
Both men distancing themselves
from the table now.
There's a high elevation lob.
Tremendous accuracy.
And a smash by Manslaughter.
And Randy Daytona
makes the save.

He stretches.

Well, that's the way the
cookie crumbles here in Korea.
As Reno's golden boy
was humiliated
in the semifinals,
and if he lives to be 100,

If he returns to America,

a heart attack, Randy!
Sorry, Rick.
It will never happen again.
I know because you're fired.
Get your stink out
of my theater.
Sorry, Randy.
But some agent
was looking for you backstage.
Maybe he missed the show.
(CLICKING TONGUE)
(SIGHS IN DESPAIR)
Thank you, Bethany.
My name's Sarah.
Are you kidding me?
Uh-uh.
You've called me Bethany
for the past five years.
It's fine.
Mr. Daytona?
Yeah.
Ernie Rodriguez, FBI.
Oh, God! I didn't mean
to hurt that guy!
How could I know that
he had a bad heart?
That's not why I'm here.
Hey, actually, I thought
that was part of the show.
Till the paramedics showed up,
I was laughing my ass off.
Well, am I in
some kind of trouble or...
No.
I came to ask you
for your help.
The FBI needs you to take part
in a top-secret mission.
One that calls for a man
of your unique skills.
I'm not joking, man.
I'm FBI. I swear.
Come on, man.
You got a hidden camera
on you, right?
Cut it out.
You're not allowed to do that.
Fake gun and everything.
(GUN FIRING)
Now why don't you put on
some big boy pants
and we'll go for a ride.
(PROJECTOR SHUTTERING)
ERNIE:
The man with the umbrella
is our target.
I think you'll want
to help us catch him, Randy.
His name is Mr. Feng.
Mr. Feng?
That's the guy
that killed my father.
I know.
His face
has never been photographed.
This sketch is based
on the description
by a late agent of the ATF.
Wait a minute,
this guy looks like...
George Takei? Mr. Sulu?
I know. It's not, though.
We checked him out.
ERNIE:
We have reason to believe
he's about to make
some kind of a major shipment
into the US.
And what, man?
What do you want me
to do about it?
What you were born to do.
You see, Randy,
Feng is a Ping-Pong fanatic.
He played for the Chinese
when he was a kid.
Now every five years
he brings the best to him.
A high-stakes tournament,
at a secret location.
Invitation only.
His men go to tournaments
all over the world,
searching for
the best of the best.
You see that gold paddle?
That's the invitation.
You, Randy,
you're our ticket in.
I'm not a spy, man.
Look, you don't have
to do anything
but play Ping-Pong, man.
You go to a few tournaments
and do your stuff.
If you're as good
as you used to be,
I'm sure
you'll get an invitation.
Look, this year Feng's
invited a who's who
of the international
most wanted list.
Randy, something big's
going down.
Here's the thing.
You're bananas.
I do matinee shows.
I get introduced
by a cockatoo.
Mr. Daytona,
you're the only one
who can lead us to Feng.
I've been authorized
to offer you
anything in the government's
power if you help us out.
You don't get it, do you, man?
I don't compete anymore!
Okay?
Maybe I never should have.
(SIGHS WEARILY)
Caucasians.
Hey, Dad. I'm sorry
I haven't been around
in awhile.
And again, I'm sorry about
abbreviating your dates
on the headstone.
(SIGHS IN DESPAIR)
The numbers were, like,
apostrophes were free so...
(SIGHS SOFTLY)
(SIGHS IN DISBELIEF)
Excuse me?
Excuse me!
The new slide's
a little close, isn't it?
What are you gonna do?
They sold the air rights
to the cemetery.
They sold the air rights
to a cemetery?
It's a pretty okay
water slide, though.
It's called Eerie Canals.
I guess it's a theme
that it's haunted. Something.
Look out!
All right. I'm in.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
(SIGHS ADORINGLY)
I love that smell.
Good to be back
on the circuit again, huh?
I meant pancakes.
I love the smell of pancakes.
Okay, you're not here
to have fun.
All right? You're here to win.
Get your head in the game.
What, do you think Feng
is gonna have scouts here?
No, but you got to win here
to get to State.
You are gonna win, right?
I can take these punks.
All right, first up
we have Andy...
(STUTTERING)
Randy Daytona
versus our four-time
Western Conference Champion,
The Hammer.
(HEAVY METAL MUSIC PLAYING)
(CROWD CHEERING)
I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.
I'm still trying to figure out
if it's a dude or a chick.
(INHALING)
(EXHALING)
No mercy, Randy.
Have your grandma
pull the car around.
(BELL RINGING)
(PEOPLE CLAPPING)
Can you dig it?
(LAUGHING)
(EXCLAIMNG IN CONCERN)
(EXCLAIMING DELIGHTEDLY)
(MOCKING)
Tastes good.
I told you I was rusty.
I haven't competed
in 19 years.
Why don't you cut me
some slack, man?
I need some time to warm up.
Time we don't have.
Feng's tournament's
in two weeks.
Man, I got to get you
in shape.
(AMBULANCE SIREN)
ERNIE:
We're here.
The world's greatest
Ping-Pong instructor
owns a takeout restaurant?
Don't hate.
The school's upstairs.
This guy's blind,
so let me do the talking.
Wong won't train just anybody.
And he never trains gweilo.
Who?
Gweilo.
It means "round eye."
Gringo. You, man.
He only takes
Chinese students.
Damn, bro.
Hey...
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
You okay, dude?
Get out!
Get out.
I don't teach gweilo.
How did you know that
we were gweilo?
Same way that I can tell
you are 30 years old.
Too old to start training.
(EXCLAIMING TRIUMPHANTLY)
Pudgy.
You are filled
with self-doubt.
(SNIFFING)
And you use Lady Speed Stick.
It was on sale.
Feng was my most gifted pupil.
He played table tennis
like the devil
in short shorts.
But he had expensive taste.
He began to steal and extort.
Turning my school
of table tennis
into a den of thieves.
And when I cast him out,
he joined the Triad.
He lured my brother Le Ping
in with him.
And when Le Ping tried
to go straight, he killed him.
Le Ping's daughter
was left fatherless.
If you help Randy and me
get to Feng's, we'll nail him.
I give you my word.
I will help you,
secret agent man.
You will start training
tomorrow, Randy.
Bring only your strength,
your honor
and a check for $300.
Hey, secret agent man.
I tell you something
right now, the truth.
Your boy will not pull it off.
We need a natural.
Something I can work with.
You know what I mean.
(SCREAMING)
Dude!
What?
What did I miss?
Well, if it isn't
the infamous Randy Daytona.
How was Disneyland?
Did you meet Dumbo?
Is it always this crowded?
Only when I'm not teaching.
WONG:
That's my niece,
Maggie Wong Mei Fei.
She brings her father,
Le Ping, great honor.
(PHONE RINGING)
Wong's Mu Shu Palace,
how can I help you?
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
WONG:
She will be the one
who will be giving you
hands-on training.
Gives "wax off"
a whole new meaning.
(GRUNTING)
Rule one, gweilo.
No touching my niece.
Understand?
Yeah, I understand.
(SIGHS IN PAIN)
(CROWD CLAPPING)
What?
Table jockey.
Let them work it out, man.
Let them work it out.
What does she weigh?
Like, 40 pounds?
Come on, man.
They're gonna kick your ass!
Who wants to... Oh.
(SCREAMING)
Maggie!
Your temper brings dishonor
to my Happy Mu Shu Palace.
You'll be sorry, Wong!
And teaching gweilo
is forbidden. You know that!
I'll tell the elders.
You will have
to face the Dragon.
Let me tell you
what you can tell the Dragon.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
(SCREAMING)
(THUDDING)
Now, gweilo, we begin.
Ping-Pong is not
the Macarena.
It takes patience.
She is like a fine,
well-aged prostitute.
It takes years
to learn her tricks.
(LAUGHING)
She is cruel.
Laughs at you
when you are naked.
(LAUGHING)
But you keep coming back
for more and more.
Why?
Because she is the
only prostitute I can afford.
(SIGHS RUEFULLY)
Gweilo, give me your paddle.
Here.
Now, for the time being,
you will practice with this.
(DERIDING)
What, are you crazy?
It's impossible, man.
Nobody can do that.
That was nice.
All right.
(SIGHS IN EXASPERATION)
Come on.
One more time.
Come on.
(BIRD CHIRPING)
Do I have to eat that?
To strengthen the body
and not the mind
is to build a temple
on shifting sand.
In my hand I hold a cricket.
What'd you do that for?
Don't take the cricket
from my hand.
Who the hell said,
"Take the cricket
from my hand"?
I just...
Put it back.
That is my lucky cricket.
Oh.
Well, he just...
He flew out of my hand, man.
You squished him?
No.
You squished lucky cricket?
No.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
Thanks a lot, kid!
So, Maggie,
what do you do
when you're not here?
So sorry,
don't speak English.
But didn't I hear
you speak English
on the phone yesterday?
No, you must be mistaken,
because I don't speak
any English.
I'm just trying
to get better acquainted.
I know what you're trying
to get, table jockey.
For as long as I can remember,
guys have been in here
with their hands all over me,
with your stupid come-ons.
"Give me a hand
with my balls, Maggie."
Let me guess.
You're not around girls much
or you probably wouldn't
play Ping-Pong, right?
Yeah, well,
I thought that your dad
played Ping-Pong.
Do not compare yourself
to my father.
My father was a great man.
I'm not. It's just a game.
It's not just a game!
It is a proud tradition
my family have devoted
their lives to!
You treat that tradition
like a joke.
Uncle says you have no honor.
I say you have no shot.
So turn off the charm,
table jockey.
(MOANING)
Oh, God.
WONG:
You need to build
wrist strength.
Eye-hand coordination.
Endurance.
(FLIES BUZZING)
Oh, come on!
You got me hitting balls
with spoons.
I'm swatting flies, now?
You not hit flies.
You hit bees.
What?
Come on!
(BEES BUZZING)
Oh, shit!
(SCREAMING)
Oh, shit!
(CRYING)
You are halfway
through your training.
Now comes the difficult part.
The backhand.
You must believe in yourself
when no one else does.
Like right now,
for instance.
What?
What do you mean
I hit the net?
Dad!
Freeze!
Hands on your head!
Oh, that's right, man.
I'm in Chinatown.
I'm sorry, man.
(GASPING)
Want to pop off
a couple of rounds?
Always makes me feel better.
Listen to me.
Are you a real,
fully-licensed FBI guy?
I'm serious, man.
I mean, why...
You know, why would
a real FBI guy
take on a mission like this?
Nobody else would
be caught dead
on Operation Ping-Pong.
All right, they don't expect
us to catch Feng.
They got 20 agents
working other angles, man.
I'm the backup plan.
Look, I joined the company
for action, man.
You know, car chases,
hang-gliding,
James Bond stuff.
Drinking martinis,
saving girls from danger.
I haven't gotten
to wear a tuxedo
since my goddaughter Martha's
quinceanera, man.
For the last five years,
I've been at a desk, typing.
I'm up to 70 words a minute.
(PHONE RINGING)
Hello.
Maggie, is that you?
Slow down.
Slow down in English.
(ALARM RINGING)
What happened?
"Teaching outsiders
is forbidden."
We've defied the elders,
now they're shutting us down.
They have
forbidden me to teach
in Chinatown, forever.
Well, don't worry.
The FBI's gonna find out
who did this.
We know who did it.
It is written right there.
No, no, no, no. No FBI.
We will settle this
in our own way.
Gweilo, only
you can restore our honor.
You must go to the elders.
You must face the Dragon.
Okay, well, time out.
We don't have time
for some ancient Chinese
pissing contest.
Feng's match is coming up.
And if we want Feng's scouts
to see Randy
win some trophies,
we got to get him out
to some tournaments.
Foolish secret agent man.
Real Ping-Pong
is not played for trophies.
It is played in the shadows,
in dark alleys and backrooms
for hard cash
and cheap, ugly women.
If gweilo beats the Dragon,
it will reach Feng's ears,
I assure you.
We're here.
The lair of the Dragon.
From here we go alone.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
Good luck, kid.
Thanks, man.
Randy, wait.
Yeah?
I want you to have this.
It belonged to my father.
Whoa.
Maggie, I can't take this.
He'd have wanted you
to have it.
Take it, you are ready.
It has defeated many enemies.
Good luck, Randy.
Thanks.
Come, gweilo.
The Dragon is the most
feared table tennis player
in all Chinatown.
Welcome to the underbelly
of Ping-Pong.
Where fortunes
are won and lost.
I'm exaggerating, of course,
but you get my point.
People bet on Ping-Pong here.
So you think you're good,
huh, gweilo?
Well, put money
where mouth is.
$4. No pay, no play.
Got change for $5?
That's all I got.
This guy doesn't seem
so tough to me.
That is not the Dragon.
That is the Dragon.
Gweilo,
remember, you suck
when you are nervous.
Thanks, Master.
First player
to lead by 3, wins.
Gweilo loses,
Wong and his descendants
are banished
from Chinatown forever.
And by extension,
all of Orange County.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
Dragon says,
"This serve, no can defend."
No one has hit it back
in five years of table tennis.
She say, "No fair.
She wasn't ready."
She say, "That wasn't real
no can defend serve.
"This next one,
this, no can defend."
"So watch out."
She say,
"Maybe we need
to take a break.
Get some fresh air. Cool off."
(PADDLE DROPS)
Yes!
I said, "Yes!"
That is right!
Am I right?
Just say, "Yes."
Fine!
Oh, jeez.
Come on, little kid.
Don't be so hard on yourself,
you know. You got mad skills.
I warn you guys,
I know tai chi.
(GRUNTING)
Here's your money.
(BLOWING NOSE)
Unfortunately,
it's covered in snot.
I knew you could do it, man!
He won, right?
What the hell?
Mr. Daytona.
Your balls have been tempered
in the fury of hell's Dragon.
Wow!
My master, Mr. Feng,
would be honored
to have you at his tournament.
Which way is the freeway?
I seem to have gotten
turned around.
Oh, yeah.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
I knew that.
Yeah.
Mr. Daytona, we'll see you
at the tournament.
What?
What am I missing?
Oh, we got the golden paddle.
As you can see, the paddle
contains a riddle in Chinese.
(READING IN CHINESE)
"On the longest day,
two hands reach
towards heaven.
"We enter the clouds."
Of course.
When both hands reach up
on what?
A clock. That's noon.
Longest day.
Wednesday, nine letters.
We enter the clouds,
that's got to be an airfield.
Yeah, but which airfield?
There are a dozen
in Orange County alone.
John Wayne Airport, maybe.
They got
a private hangar there
owned by a Japanese
corporation goes by
the name of Haiku Cargo.
Check this out.
On the longest day.
Yeah. It's 5-7-5.
That's a haiku.
That's impressive.
Yeah.
It's on the back of
the paddle here in English.
Noon, Wednesday,
John Wayne Airport.
Each player can bring
a coach, a doctor,
two carry-ons.
Goose, run them through
the hardware they'll need.
I have stripped
everything down for you.
This is your homing device,
this is the transmitter.
So you just plant it,
flip the switch
and backup's on its way.
Don't screw this up,
Rodriguez.
Do not signal
unless you have proof
of what Feng is up to.
We don't want theories.
We want him caught red-handed,
with hard evidence,
so we can put him away
for good.
Yes, sir.
So let me guess, fellows.
We're gonna stick this
in the heel of our shoe,
put it in
a tube of toothpaste,
something like that?
I think we'll have
to sneak this in
the old-fashioned way.
What's the old-fashioned way?
(GRUNTING)
God, slow down.
We should go alone from here.
Good luck, secret agent man.
Take care of Uncle, okay?
Uncle can take care
of himself.
Oh, man.
What's the stick for, man?
Come on.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)
Okay.
Never hug a man with
a million bucks worth of
hardware up his crack.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Go ahead and kiss her already!
So embarrass...
Come back, gweilo.
Bye.
(GROANING)
Nice plane.
Team Daytona.
This way, gentlemen.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Where we going, Tijuana?
(BUS HONKING)
(GONGING)
It is with great honor
that I present your host.
The man
who sold the Dragon his fire,
stole it back,
and sold it again
to the Crips.
Give it up for Master Feng.
(PEOPLE CLAPPING)
How's my collar?
Man, we were
way off George Takei.
Okie-dokie artichokie.
First of all,
I know getting here
was the commute from hell.
I have to be a smidge
off the beaten track here.
Now, Ping-Pong,
or, as the Chinese say,
"Ping-Pong,"
sport of emperors
and bandits alike.
I have assembled today,
for your entertainment
pleasure,
the most talented
table tennis athletes
from around the globe.
Legends, every one.
We have last year's
North American champion
and holder
of the Canadian cup,
Mr. Freddy "Fingers" Wilson.
Represent.
Four-time Australian champion,
Mr. Wedge McDonald!
Cutie.
From Japan,
Mr. Yukito Nagasaki!
My personal odds-on favorite
from the '88 games,
possibly the greatest player
ever to emerge from the West.
He came out of retirement
to be here,
and it's an honor to have him.
He's back and he's bad,
the one and only
Karl Wolfschtagg!
Yeah!
So, we meet again.
The years have not been
kind to you.
I will not be either.
We have champions from
every continent so, please,
everyone, wear a nametag.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
And now, eat, drink, enjoy.
My goodness!
What a blast from the past!
If it isn't my old master.
Wong.
You old horn dog.
How's tricks?
I've waited many years
to meet you again,
face to face.
Oh, thank you.
Tell me, Randy, does he still
dress as if he shops
at Elton John's garage sale?
So, Randy Daytona.
The golden boy
who couldn't even bronze.
You're Wong's new protg.
Well, FYI,
Wong always said
I was his greatest pupil.
I said you could have
been great, but you never
finished your training.
As I recall,
you kicked me out.
But you did teach me
one thing, Master.
Promptness.
And you were 15 minutes late
to the banquet.
Soup got cold.
Oh, Feng!
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
Don't let it happen again.
Gentlemen. Athletes.
I bid you toodles.
(PLAYING MUSIC)
May I invite you to select
from one of Mr. Feng's
courtesans of pleasure.
Like sex slaves?
No.
No, I couldn't do that.
No, I couldn't. I couldn't.
No, no.
I got this girlfriend
back home.
I mean, she's not
my girlfriend. "Yet."
Mr. Feng has gone
to great lengths
to select the most
beautiful courtesans
from around the world.
They are fully versed
in both the sensual
and the erotic arts.
Well, I mean,
I don't want to be rude.
(GONGING)
What's up?
These are...
These are all...
These guys,
these are dudes.
They are fully prepared
to satisfy each and every one
of your desires.
Well, my desires
are pretty much
all satisfied up, right now.
So, I'm good.
You must choose one.
(SMIRKING)
Look, tell Feng
they are all so great...
Fine. I'll pick.
Gary.
Yo!
Feeling good?
Oh, yeah.
Hop to it.
The rest of you, get out.
That...
(STUTTERING)
Can I talk to you
for a second?
Sweet dreams, Mr. Daytona.
I got a huge day tomorrow.
Big day.
Can you...
No can do.
Look, if I don't spend
the night in here, it's...
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm not kidding.
If I had known
I'd end up as a sex slave,
I never would've gone
to that audition in Orlando.
I thought I was gonna be doing
cruise ship shows.
Next thing I know, boom.
Sex slave.
Always read
the fine print, amigo.
Hey, you want a brew?
I sure could use one.
Yeah.
Yeah. Cool.
Here you go, dude.
So... So.
Board game?
You want to play a board game?
Yes, play a board game.
Okay, cool.
Whoa, you got Boggle, huh?
That sounds like
a challenge to me.
Yeah, okay, sure.
All right.
Sounds like somebody's
getting lucky.
Oh, no, no, dude.
I want a rematch.
Best out of seven!
You can not defeat me.
I am the Boggle master.
Kick some ass out there.
Kick some ass, all right?
All right. Thanks, man.
Appreciate it.
Be careful. Okay?
All we did was play Boggle.
Hey, how you doing, Master?
Good morning.
Oh, gweilo.
Have you tried
these pleasure girls?
My girl, she really knows
how to handle a man.
Oh, boy!
What the hell is up
with these courtesans
of pleasure?
Master had a fantastic time
last night.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
Did you find anything?
They got this place
locked down pretty tight,
but I'm gonna
snoop around today.
Okay.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
Huh?
He needs to go to bathroom.
Down the hall,
eighth door on the left.
The switch is on the right.
(GONGING)
Welcome to
my tournament of champions.
The tournament
is single elimination,
sudden death.
Let the games begin.
The game is to 11.
Must win by two.
(SHUFFLING)
The first competitors are...
Freddy "Fingers" Wilson.
Wonderful.
This is Freddy Fingers.
(SCREAMING)
(CROWD CLAPPING)
And...
Randy Daytona.
Hello, Feng's mansion!
How was Disneyland?
(CROWD LAUGHING)
Good luck, man.
Blow it out your ass, bitch.
(LAUGHING)
MAHOGANY:
Game point.
Randy Daytona is the victor.
Randy!
RANDY:
Give it up!
Can I hear a word?
Can I hear a double "huh-huh"?
FENG:
Randy.
Fantastique.
Wong always did have
an eye for talent.
Too bad they're not good
for anything else.
You killed him?
Well, duh.
What part of "sudden death"
didn't you understand?
Ow!
What's up?
Come, walk with me.
Randy, I have
a proposition for you.
I won't bite.
Not anywhere that will show.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Guess a guy like you has to
have a lot of security around
all the time, huh?
Oh, them.
They're just for show.
Nobody'd try anything in here.
Give me the thing.
This is the real security.
The whole place
is wired to blow.
I'd hate to have to relocate.
The place ain't much,
but it's homey.
Voila.
I don't usually
give strangers the full tour,
but I don't know. Randy...
(MOUTHING) I like you.
Go ahead.
After you.
Guns is my new business,
and business is booming.
These new polymer guns
go on sale Thursday.
They go right through
a metal detector.
Enough shop talk.
Let me show you
my pride and joy.
Snazzy.
Yeah.
It's my own private table.
Custom made.
You have to wear
these vests to play.
The batteries in them
store enough electricity
to kill 3.8 men.
Every time you miss,
the voltage doubles.
Two-nothing feels like
you just stuck a fork
in a toaster.
Nobody's ever made it
past three-zip.
This guy here,
five-time world champ.
Randy, let me cut through
the bullpoop.
I'd like you to come
and work for me as my
personal assistantlhanger-on.
Me?
Yeah.
Why?
Because I think
you'd make a wonderful
addition to the Triad.
Really? Me?
Of course not, no.
I want you 'cause
it would break Wong's heart.
Me, his old pupil,
luring his protg
to the dark side
is such a Kodak moment.
Do you have any idea
how hard it is
to get a panda these days?
Really hard.
Maybe he's dead. I'm not sure.
I'm not really sure
what they eat.
Oh, well.
Back to the old grindstone.
Oh, man.
(SCREAMING)
You're gonna come
to the Vishnu shrine
in the bamboo grove.
You're gonna go, lower hand
low five, lower hand low five,
upper hand high five.
And then you're in.
You got it?
What?
If the guns are there,
I'll set the beacon
and my guys will be here
before he scores another
point. All right? Relax.
Just hurry!
I blow you a fart.
How do you like that?
Randy Daytona
versus Yukito Nagasaki.
This one is for you, Daytona!
MAHOGANY:
Set and match.
Where's everybody at?
Coming up after the break,
the final round.
Randy Daytona
versus Karl Wolfschtagg.
(GONGING)
You are so close to defeat,
till it already reeks
of your cheap cologne.
The joke's on you, pretty boy.
It's not cologne,
it's Lady Speed Stick.
Thank you, Master.
(FIRECRACKERS BURSTING)
Listen to me. You said that
you were gonna get me out
of here, right?
They were supposed
to be here by now.
Look, don't worry, Randy.
I got a plan B.
You got a plan B?
Trust me.
Meet me in the john
in two minutes.
Welcome to Feng's bathroom.
Hey.
May I interest you
in an Altoid
or some Axe Body Spray?
Hey, these shoes
look like they need a shine?
Hi.
Hi.
Daytona.
I have said some cruel things
about you to my friends
here at the tournament.
I told them that the reason
that you hate me so much
is because I had sex
with your mother.
My mother died when I was two.
I hardly knew her.
Yeah, I know.
It's a horrible thing to say.
And yet these things
that I say,
over and over again,
I do not mean them.
'Cause, in truth,
you are the greatest player
I have ever seen.
Other than myself.
Practicing in front
of a mirror.
Which I do.
Every day.
In the nude.
I'm sorry for you
that your papa
is not here to see you.
I think he would
be very proud of you.
Yeah.
So proud of you
that he would probably bet
some money on you again.
I could use the cash. Ha-ha.
Tell your dead parents
I said, "What's up?"
(LAUGHING)
We're staying.
Win or lose,
I got to play him.
I can't keep running away
from that German fruit salad.
Now I am proud.
It is better to die
like a tiger
than to live like a pussy.
I'm gonna go tell Rodriguez.
Rodriguez?
Rodriguez?
Open! Eat it!
Eat it!
(MOANING IN PAIN)
How was I supposed to know
you were gonna
change your mind?
Silence. What's done is done.
Let's hope it works.
I hate you guys.
Mr. Feng,
there's been an accident.
Oh, no!
What have you...
I broke it.
Oh, my God!
Did that hurt?
Yes!
Oh, dear.
I have no choice.
I have to disqualify you.
I suppose
Karl is our champion.
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!
This is far from over,
Daytona!
AUDIENCE:
You suck!
Hey! Hey, come on.
That stings. Who said that?
Well, poop.
Randy, I was serious
about my offer, okay?
And e-mail me
when you make up your mind.
"Pradafan" is all one word.
I can't tell you
how disappointed I am.
(YELLING IN CHINESE)
I'm afraid your reputation
has preceded you,
Agent Rodriguez.
Are you still waiting
for your backup?
Bad guys have
homing beacons, too.
(SIGHING)
Competition will continue
as scheduled.
Hope you're a good southpaw.
MAHOGANY:
Three-point game.
To the death.
Come on.
(EXCLAIMING NERVOUSLY)
I'm cool, man. I'm cool.
Oops. Clumsy, clumsy hippos.
You should be more careful
with your racquet.
It's not like
I get these shoes for free.
Oh, wait. Yes, I do.
I do get them for free.
Time out.
Master, look.
It's your brother's paddle.
It's my winning paddle.
I mean, I don't know
what the hell
I'm gonna do now.
Gweilo!
Have I taught you nothing?
Game not in paddle.
Game in you.
You cannot change
what is past.
You must play for this man.
Here, use this paddle.
It belongs to the greatest
player I have ever known.
Thanks, Master.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
Gunter, glieben,
glauchen, globen
All right
I got something to say
Yeah, it's better to burn out
Yeah, than fade away
All right
Gonna start a fire
Come on
Rise up, gather round
Rock this place to the ground
Burn it up, let's go for broke
Watch the night go up in smoke
Rock on, rock on
Drive me crazier
No serenade, no fire brigade
Just pyromania, come on
What do you want?
What do you want?
I want rock 'n' roll
Yes, I do
Long live rock 'n' roll
Oh, let's go,
let's strike a light
We're gonna blow like dynamite
(GUN FIRING)
There will be a slight change
in today's program
for the final match.
The part of Karl Wolfschtagg
will be played by...
Maggie!
Randy.
Maggie!
No, Randy, no.
You get to play her
to the death.
I thought this would be
much more interesting, huh?
You bastard.
What?
This is an outrage!
This is an outrage!
I demand retribution!
I did not come all this way...
Oh, great, blow dart, yeah?
Super.
(CROWD CLAPPING)
Master, you got to
help me out.
You got to give me
some advice, anything, please.
Sorry, gweilo, I'm out.
"Game not in paddle,
game in you,"
is usually my big finish.
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
Hey. Less talkie-talkie.
More Ping-Pong.
MAHOGANY:
Three-point game to the death.
Maggie, come on.
I'm not gonna play you, Randy.
It would be an honor for me
to give you my life.
MAHOGANY:
One-zero. Randy Daytona.
I don't know why
you couldn't just say
that you love me.
I...
MAHOGANY:
One-One.
That's not fair.
That wasn't fair.
Randy, I'm trying to sacrifice
my life for our love.
Stop being such a dick!
I'm not gonna let you lose,
Maggie.
Here we go.
This is not very honorable!
I love you, Maggie.
Boring. Kill them.
Kill them both.
We're missing
Antiques Roadshow.
No.
Oh, crap!
Get to cover! Come on!
You want to play rough?
Okay! Go! Go! Go!
Stop it! Are you insane?
These are not replicas!
Well, some of them are,
but they're
limited edition replicas.
Backup's right outside,
they just signaled.
I didn't sneak in
two of these for nothing.
This is the FBI.
Oh, my God!
What?
Wait a minute,
I forgot something, guys.
What?
Come here, baby.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Get to the dock!
He took my Uzi.
Get away from the door!
Sweet.
Well, that was awesome of me.
Dude, I totally knew
you'd rescue me!
Okay! All right! Okay!
All right! As a friend!
As a friend, I rescued you.
Oh, right. Yeah. Right.
Follow me!
This way. Up the stairs!
Oh, crap!
(SCREAMING)
So what? What?
What are you gonna do?
You gonna murder me
like you murdered my father?
You people sound
like a broken record.
"You killed my so-and-so
and you murdered
what's- his-face."
"I demand..."
Blah-blah-blah. Get over it.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't, don't, don't. Feng.
Listen, you kill me now,
we're never gonna know
who Wong's best pupil is.
WONG: For the record,
I think we all assume
that it is Randy.
You win, Wong.
Let's settle this,
once and for all.
This rescue sucks, dude.
I know.
Huh?
Not you, you're doing great.
Guys. Guys. Guys!
You, take
the self-destruct doohickey.
Just show it to the FBI.
Explain the house
is rigged to blow.
That will buy us time.
Ready, gweilo?
(ELECTRICITY HUMMING)
Any last words?
Yeah.
ELECTRONIC VOICE :
Self-destruct sequence
activated.
(ELECTRONIC VOICE
SPEAKING JAPANESE)
ELECTRONIC VOICE :
Five minutes to detonation
and counting.
It's your point, Feng.
I know. My serve, I think.
What the hell are you doing?
It's over, Feng.
The Ping-Pong table
doesn't know that.
If we stop playing,
it will kill us both.
You mean,
you can't turn it off?
God, that's so stupid!
Randy.
Get to the boat!
Okay, let's get out of here.
I'm gonna save the panda!
The panda's dead!
All right, FBI!
You are all under arrest!
FBI!
FBI!
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
Oh, shit!
That's my point, Feng.
But you missed the table!
I changed the rules a little.
I should have told you.
The way I play,
you could hit it off
anything you want.
One bounce, it counts.
My bad.
Son of a bitch!
Guys!
This guy looks really tough.
You take him.
ELECTRONIC VOICE :
Two minutes to detonation.
You should've taken my offer.
I would've given you anything.
Anything in the world!
I want my father back!
Lots of luck!
Come on, get up.
Come on, fast, fast, fast.
Heads down. Heads down.
Get your own boat, Pedro!
I call this one.
(SHRIEKING)
Guys! Guys!
Me, the money
and the Chinese broad
are taking off.
You see this pen?
This pen contains enough
cyanide to kill everyone
within 100-yard radius.
Do you think I'd come in here
without a backup plan?
I'm FBI, pendejo!
Now, here's
how it's gonna go down.
Hola. You like chorizo?
Let's get out of here.
He's gonna be really mad.
Randy!
Remember
what I told you, gweilo!
Feng only finished
one-half of his training.
Come on.
I believe it's my serve, Feng.
Big deal.
I never finished the training.
What's that mean?
I have no honor or something?
It means you have
no backhand.
Oh, shit!
ELECTRONIC VOICE :
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six...
Jump!
... five, four, three,
two, one.
Dude, that was amazing!
I love you!
We are so proud of you!
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Seriously, stop it!
You ready, pussycat?
Say hello to my little friend!
Are you okay?
Let's go, pussycat,
one more time.
You got it?
Yeah.
Oh, no!
I heard that.
ERNIE:
Okay, no more games.
Let me help you with that,
Master.
There you go.
Hey, I wanted to thank you
for everything
that you've done for me.
So I got you
a little something.
It's really not necessary.
But Master will accept.
What is it?
Let me guess.
It's something small.
No, don't...
Cufflinks? It's a ring.
I love jewelry.
I can't guess. What is it?
It's a new lucky cricket.
Oh.
Was.
I shall carry it
with me always.
Yeah.
Don't bother.
He's pretty much dead.
No, no, no.
I will carry the box.
It will bring my spare change
great honor.
Okay, you do that.
You do that.
Hey, gweilo!
I just want to say
no hard feelings, huh?
Good luck
on the new school, gweilo.
Thanks, man.
(SPEAKING CHINESE)
Dragon say, "May Wong's
school of table tennis
last 1,000 years.
"Or at least until the lease
is up in August."
Oh, thanks.
It's nice.
Thank you very much.
You know, I think
we all learned
a valuable lesson.
Dragon say, "This is
not over yet, whitey!"
Walk it off, Randy.
A true Ping-Pong player
must always be aware
of his surroundings.
(THUDDING)
Master, are you all right?
WONG:
I am going to Disneyland.
Maybe we should
keep this closed.
There's a gate here.
There's a blind man
walking around.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
Feng!
Shit!
I'm not leaving without you,
Ying-Ying!
Panda's totally fake.
Feng, not Fang.
Feng?
Feng.
I've been calling you Fang
this whole time.
F-E-N-G.
Feng?
All right.
Please.

( SonarPings)
Man:
( SonarPings)
Okay, take her up
and overthe bow rail.
( OverRadio ):
Okay, Mir2, we're going overthe bow.
Staywith us.
( SonarPings)
( Mechanical Whirring)
Okay, quiet. We're rolling.
Seeing her coming out of
the darkness like a ghost ship
still gets me everytime--
To see the sad ruin
ofthe great ship sitting here
where she landed at 2:30
in the morning ofApril 1 5, 1 91 2
after her long fall
from the world above.
( ManSnickers)
You are so full ofshit, boss.
- ( Giggles)
- ( Mechanical Whirring)
( SonarPinging)
Man: Dive six-- Here we are again
on the deck of Titanic
The pressure outside is
These windows are nine inches thick
and ifthey go
it's sayonara
in two microseconds.
All right, enough
ofthat bullshit.
( Mechanical Whirring)
Just put her down on the roofof
the officer's quarters likeyesterday.
- Man: Sure.
- Man ( OverRadio ): Okay, Mir 2.
We have landed right on the grand
staircase. You guys set to launch?
Yeah, Brock-- Launching Dunkin now.
Go, Charlie.
- All right, tether out.
- Man: Tether out.
Man ( OverRadio ): Okay, Brock,

Rogerthat. Okay, drop down and go
into the first-class gangway door.
I wantyou guys working the D deck
reception area and the dining saloon.
Man ( OverRadio ):
Copythat.
- Tether out.
- Man: Tether out.
- Now left, left.
- I'm coming left.
Brock:
Snoop Dog is on the move.
We're headed down the stairwell.
Okay, Lewis, drop down to B deck.
A deck.
Lewis:
Give me some rope, Captain.
B deck-- get in there,
get in there.
Brock: Watch the doorframe.
Watch the doorframe.
- I see it. I got it.
- ( Bang)
( Mechanical Whirring)
- ( Cracking)
- We're good.Just chill, boss.
Brock:
Makeyourturn. Come around.
- Lewis: Cable out, Captain.
- Makeyourturn. Watch the wall.
Yeah, Brock,
we're at the piano,you copy?
Brock:
Okay, copythat.
Brock: Okay, right there.
Right there. That's it!
- That's the bedroom door.
- I see it. I see it.
We're in!
We're in, baby. We're there!
Brock: That's Hockley's bed.
That's where the son ofa bitch slept.
Lewis:
Oops, somebody left the water running.
Hey, hold itjust a second.
Go backto the right.
That wardrobe door--
get closer.
- You smelling something, boss?
- I want to see what's under it.
- Give me my hands, man.
- ( Mechanical Whirring)
All right.
- Take it easy, it might come apart.
- Okay.
Go, go, go, go.
Flip it over. Flip it over. Go.
Keep going, go, go, go.
Okay, drop it.
Oh, baby, baby,
areyou seeing this, boss?
It's payday, boys.
(ManSpeaking OverLoudspeaker)
( Cheering)
( lmitates Cash Register):
Ka-ching!
- We did it, Bobby.
- Lewis: Oh,yeah. Who's the man?
Who's the best, baby?
Say it. Say it.
You are, Lewis.
( SawBuzzingLoudly)
- Bobby, my cigar.
- Bobby: Right here.
( Cheering)
Brock:
Okay, crack her open.
( ManSpeaking OverLoudspeaker)
Shit.
No diamond.
You know, boss, this same thing
happened to Geraldo
and his career never recovered.
Turn the camera off.
Bobby: Brock, the partners
would like to know how it's going.
Hey, Dave, Barry, hi.
Look, it wasn't in the safe
but hey, hey,
don't worry about it.
There's still plenty
of places it could be.
Hell yes! Floor debris in the suite, the
mother's room, purser's safe on C deck.
-Jimmy Hoffa's briefcase.
- Brock: A dozen other places.
Guys, look,you'vejust got to trust
my instincts. I know we're close.
Wejust got to go through
a little process ofelimination.
Hang on a second.
- Let me see that.
- We might have something here, guys.
Where's the photograph
ofthe necklace?
We'll call you right back.
I'll be goddamned.
Reporter: Treasure hunter Brock Lovett
is best known forfinding Spanish gold.
It's okay.
I'll feed you in a minute.
Now he has chartered
Russian subs to reach
the most famous shipwreck
ofall: the Titanic.
He is with us live
via satellite
from the research ship Keldysh
in the North Atlantic.
- Hello, Brock.
- Brock: Hello, Tracy.
Everyone knows the familiar
stories of Titanic--
the nobility, the band playing
till the very end and all that.
But what I'm interested in
are the untold stories
the secrets locked deep
inside the hull of Titanic.
We're out here using
robot technology
to go further into the wreck
than anybody's ever done before.
Your expedition is at the center
ofa storm ofcontroversy
over salvage rights
and even ethics.
Many are callingyou
a grave robber.
Nobody called the recovery ofartifacts
of King Tut's tomb "grave robbing."
- Woman: What is it?
- Turn that up, dear.
I have museum-trained experts
out here making sure
that these relics are preserved
and catalogued properly.
Take a look at this drawing
that we foundjust today:
A piece of paperthat's been
underwaterfor 84 years
and myteam were able
to preserve it intact.
Should this have remained unseen at
the bottom ofthe ocean for eternity?
I'll be goddamned.
Man (Over Loudspeaker):
Vnimanye, vnimanye...
Bobby: Brock!
There's a satellite call foryou.
Bobby, we're launching. You see
these submersibles going in the water?
Trust me, buddy.
You want to take this call.
This better be good.
You got to speak up.
She's kind ofold.
Great. This Brock Lovett.
- How can I helpyou, Mrs.--
- Calvert. Rose Calvert.
Mrs. Calvert?
I wasjust wondering ifyou had found
the Heart ofthe Ocean yet, Mr. Lovett.
Told you you wanted
to take the call.
All right,you have
my attention, Rose.
Can you tell us who the woman
in the picture is?
Oh,yes.
The woman in the picture is me.
( Yelling OverEngineNoise):
She's a goddamned liar--
Some nut case seeking
money or publicity.
God only knows why, like that
Russian babe, Anesthesia.
They're inbound!
Rose Dewitt Bukater died on the Titanic
when she was 1 7, right?
- That's right.
- Ifshe had lived, she'd be over 1 00.
Okay, so she's a very old
goddamned liar.
Look, I've already done
the background on this woman
all the way backto the '20s
when she was working as an actress.
An actress! There's
yourfirst clue, Sherlock.
Her name was Rose Dawson backthen.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.
They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.
Now, Calvert's dead, and from what
I hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.
And everybodywho
knows about the diamond
is supposed to be dead
or on this boat, but she knows.
Doesn't exactly
travel light, does she?
Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.
Welcome to the Keldysh.
Okay, let's get her
inside there.
- Hi, Ms. Calvert.
- Hi.
Welcome to the Keldysh.
Man:
Hey. Hey!
- ( Knocking)
- Rose: Yes?
- Areyour staterooms all right?
- Rose: Oh,yes, very nice.
Haveyou met
my granddaughter Lizzie?
She takes care of me.
We metjust
a few minutes ago.
Remember, Nana, up on deck?
There, that's nice.
Have to have my pictures
when I travel.
Can I getyou anything?
ls there anythingyou'd like?
Yes.
I would like to see my drawing.
Brock:
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone
that was called
the Blue Diamond ofthe Crown
which disappeared in 1 792
about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.
The theory goes that
the crown diamond was chopped, too
recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as "Heart ofthe Ocean."
Today it would be worth more
than the Hope Diamond.
It was a dreadful, heavything.
I onlywore it this once.
Lizzie:
You actuallythinkthis isyou, Nana?
It is me, dear.
Wasn't I a dish?
I tracked it down
through insurance records--
An old claim that was settled
underterms ofabsolute secrecy.
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?
I should imagine
someone named Hockley.
Brock: Nathan Hockley, that's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.
Claim was for
a diamond necklace
his son Caledon
bought his fiancee--you
a week before
he sailed on Titanic.
It was filed right
afterthe sinking
so the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.
You see the date?
"April 1 4, 1 91 2."
Which means ifyour grandmother is
who she says she is
she was wearing the diamond
the daythe Titanicsank.
And that makesyou
my new best friend.
These are some ofthe things
we recovered from your stateroom.
This was mine.
How extraordinary!
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.
The reflection
has changed a bit.
( GaspsQuietly)
Areyou readyto go
backto Titanic?
Lewis: Okay, here we go. She hits
the berg on the starboard side, right?
She kind of bumps along punching holes
like Morse code-- dit-dit-dit--
along the side,
below the waterline.
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.
Now as the water level rises, it
spills overthe watertight bulkheads
which unfortunately
don't go any higherthan E deck.
So now as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up
slow at first, then faster
and faster until finally
she's got herwhole ass is sticking
up in the air and that's a big ass.
We're talking
And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure, so what happens?
She splits,
right down to the keel
and the stern
falls back level.
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the
stern vertical and finally detaches.
Now, the stern sectionjust
kind of bobs there like a cork
for a couple of minutes, floods and
finally goes under about 2:20 a.m.
two hours and 40 minutes
afterthe collision.
The bow section planes away
landing about a halfa mile away
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.
( lmitates Crashing)
Pretty cool, huh?
Thankyou forthat fine
forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.
Ofcourse,
the experience of it was
somewhat different.
Will you share it with us?
( Music Playing)
( Crying)
- I'm taking herto rest.
- No.
- Come on, Nana.
- No!
Tape recorder.
Tell us, Rose.
It's been 84 years.
It's okay.Just tryto remember
anything-- anything at all.
Doyou want to hearthis
or not, Mr. Lovett?
It's been 84 years...
and I can still smell
the fresh paint.
The china had never been used.
The sheets had never
been slept in.
Titanicwas called
"The Ship of Dreams"
and it was, it reallywas.
Man: All third-class passengers
with a forward berth
this way, please, this queue.
- Right here.
- Big boat, huh?
- Daddy, it's a ship.
- You're right.
( CarHorn Tooting)
I don't see what
all the fuss is about.
It doesn't look any bigger
than the Mauritania.
You can be blase about some things,
Rose, but not about Titanic.
It's over 1 00 feet longerthan
Mauritania and far more luxurious.
Your daughter is fartoo difficult
to impress, Ruth.
So this is the ship
they say is unsinkable.
It is unsinkable.
God Himselfcould not sinkthis ship.
Sir,you have to check
your baggage through the main terminal.
- It's round that way, sir.
- I put myfaith in you, good sir.
- Now, kindly see my man.
- Yes, sir, my pleasure, sir.
- If I can do anything at all.
- Oh,yes, right.
All the trunks
from that carthere
to the parlor suite,
rooms B-52, 54, 56.

- Ladies...
better hurry.
( People Saying Good-byes)
- My coat?
- Woman: I have it.

due here for a health inspection.

Uh-oh. Two pair.
I'm sorry, Fabrizio.
Che"sorry?" Ma vaffanculo!
You bet all the money.
I'm sorry,you're not going to see

We're riding in high style now.
We're a couple of regular swells.
We're practically goddamn royalty,

Fabrizio:
You see, it's my destino!
Like I told you,
I go to America to be milionario.

- Bastardo!
- You're pazzo!
- Maybe, but I've got the tickets.
- Come on, I thoughtyou were fast.
- Aspetta!
Wait, wait! Hey, wait!
We're passengers. Passengers.
Haveyou been through
the inspection queue?
Ofcourse.
Anyway, we don't have any lice.
- We're Americans, both of us.
- Right, come aboard.
We're the luckiest sons of bitches
in the world,you know that?
( Ship's Horn Blares)
Good-bye!
- You know somebody?
- Ofcourse not. That's not the point.
Good-bye! I'll missyou!
Good-bye! I'm going
to neverforgetyou.

All the way, darling.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Oh, right here.
Hey, howyou doing?
Jack. Nice to meetyou.
I'mJack Dawson.
Nice to meetyou.
Howyou doing?
Who saysyou get the top bunk?
( SpeakingSwedish )
This isyour private
promenade deck, sir.
Would you be
requiring anything?
- Hmm.
- Excuse me.
- Woman: This one?
- Rose: No. It had a lot offaces on it.
This is the one.
Would you like
all ofthem out, miss?
Yes, we need a little color
in this room.
Put it in there,
in the wardrobe.
God, not those finger paintings again.
They certainlywere a waste of money.
The difference between Cal's taste
in art and mine is that I have some.
They're fascinating, like being
inside a dream or something.
- There's truth, but no logic.
- What's the artist's name?
- Something Picasso.
- "Something Picasso."
He won't amount to a thing.
He won't, trust me.
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
- At least theywere cheap.
Ah, put it in the wardrobe.
AtCherbourg, a woman came
aboardnamedMargaretBrown.
We all calledherMolly.
Historywould callher
"the Unsinkable MollyBrown. "
Well, I wasn't about to wait
all dayforyou, sonny.
Here,you thinkyou can manage?
Herhusbandhadstruckgold
someplace out West
andshe was whatmothercalled
"newmoney. "
By thenext afternoon, we were steaming
westfrom the coastoflreland
with nothing outaheadofus

Take herto sea, Mr. Murdoch.
- Let's stretch her legs.
- Yes, sir.
- All ahead full, Mr. Moody.
- Very good, sir.
- ( Bells Ringing)
- ( BelIRings)
- All ahead full.
- Man ( Shouting): All ahead full!
Come on, lads. Get moving.
What's the reading?
( Crew TalkingAndShouting)
All right,
let's stoke them right up!
We're going full ahead!
Hey, look, look, look!
Look, look!
See it?
There's another one. See him?
Look at that one.
Look at himjump!
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!
I can see the
Statue of Liberty already!
Very small, ofcourse.
I'm the king ofthe world!
( WhoopingAnd Yelling)
( Whooping)
Man: She's the largest
moving object ever made
bythe hand of man
in all history.
And our master shipbuilder,
Mr. Andrews here
designed her
from the keel plates up.
Well, I may have
knocked hertogether
but the idea was Mr. Ismay's.
He envisioned a steamer so grand
in scale and so luxurious
in its appointments that its
supremacywould never be challenged.
And here she is
willed into solid reality.
Man:
Hear, hear.
You know I don't
like that, Rose.
She knows.
We'll both have the lamb, rare,
with very little mint sauce.
Hmm,you like lamb,
right, sweet pea?
Areyou going to cut her meat
for her, too, there, Cal?
Hey, uh, who thought
ofthe name "Titanic"?
- Was ityou, Bruce?
- Well,yes, actually.
I wanted to convey sheer size
and the size means stability
Iuxury, and above all,
strength.
Doyou know of Dr. Freud,
Mr. Ismay?
His ideas about the male
preoccupation with size
might be of particular
interest toyou.
- What's gotten intoyou?
- Excuse me.
- I do apologize.
- She's a pistol, Cal.
- Hopeyou can handle her.
- Well, I may have to start minding...
what she reads from now on,
won't l, Mrs. Brown?
Freud-- Who is he?
ls he a passenger?
( Man ExplainingPropeller
To Little Girl)
It makes these waves,
makes them spin.
Fabrizio:
The ship is nice, huh?
- Yeah, it's an lrish ship.
- Is English, no?
No, it was built in lreland.
Solid as a rock.
Big lrish hands.
That's typical. First-class dogs
come down here to take a shit.
Uh, it lets us know where we rank
in the scheme ofthings.
Like we could forget?
- I'm Tommy Ryan.
-Jack Dawson.
- Hello.
- Fabrizio.
Hi. Doyou make any money
with your drawings?
Oh, forget it, boyo. You'd as like
have angels fly outyour arse
as get next
to the likes of her.
( Laughs)
- Doyou mind?
- I hopeyou're proud ofthis.

Don't do it.
Stay back.
Don't come any closer.
Come on.Just give meyour hand.
I'll pull you back over.
No! Staywhereyou are.
I mean it.
I'll let go.
No,you won't.
What doyou mean, no, I won't?
Don't presume to tell me what I will
and will not do. You don't know me.
Well,you would have
done it already.
You're distracting me.
Go away.
I can't. I'm involved now.
You let go and I'm going to have to
jump in there afteryou.
Don't be absurd.
You'll be killed.
- I'm a good swimmer.
- The fall alone would kill you.
- It would hurt.
- I'm not saying it wouldn't.
To tell you the truth
I'm a lot more concerned
about that water being so cold.
( ShoeDrops To Deck)
- How cold?
- Freezing.
Maybe a couple degrees over.
You ever, uh...
ever been to Wisconsin?
What?
Well, they have some
ofthe coldest winters around.
I grew up there
near Chippewa Falls.
I rememberwhen I was a kid,
me and myfather, we went ice fishing
out on Lake Wissota.
Ice fishing is,you know,
whereyou--
( Angrily):
I know what ice fishing is!
Sorry.
Youjust seem like,you know,
kind ofan indoor girl.
Anyway, l, uh...
I fell through some thin ice
and I'm tellingyou...
waterthat cold,
like right down there
it hitsyou like a thousand knives
stabbingyou all overyour body.
You can't breathe,
you can't think--
at least not about anything
but the pain.
Which is why I'm not looking forward
tojumping in there afteryou.
Like I said...
I don't have a choice.
I guess I'm kind of hoping
you'll come back overthe rail
and get me offthe hook here.
You're crazy.
That's what everybody says,
but with all due respect, miss
I'm not the one hanging off
the back ofa ship here.
Come on.
Come on, give meyour hand.
You don't want to do this.
Whew!
I'mJack Dawson.
Rose Dewitt Bukater.
I'm going to have to getyou
to write that one down.
Come on.
- ( Screams)
- ( Grunting)
I gotyou! Come on.
Come on!
( Screams)
Help! Please!
Help! Please!
- Please get me!
- Listen. Listen to me.
I've gotyou. I won't let go.
Now pull yourself up. Come on.
( Grunts)
Come on. That's right.
You can do it.
I gotyou.
What's all this?
You stand back!
And don't move an inch!
- Fetch the master-at-arms!
- Care for a brandy?
Cal: This is completely unacceptable!
What madeyou think
thatyou could putyour hands
on myfiancee?
- Look at me,you filth!
- Cal...
- What doyou thinkyou were doing?
- Cal, stop.
- It was an accident.
- An accident?
It was. Stupid really.
I was leaning over,
and I slipped.
I was leaning far over
to see the, uh...
uh... uh...
the, uh... uh...
- Propellers?
- propellers and I slipped.
And I would have gone overboard
but Mr. Dawson here saved me
and almost went over himself.
You wanted to see...
She wanted to see the propellers.
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.
Was that the way of it?
Yeah. Yeah,
that was pretty much it.
Well, the boy's a hero then.
Good foryou, son. Well done.
So it's all's well
and backto our brandy, eh?
Look atyou. You must be freezing.
Let's getyou inside.
Perhaps a little something
forthe boy.
Ofcourse. Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?
Rose is displeased.
What to do?
I know.
Perhapsyou couldjoin us
for dinnertomorrow evening
to regale our group
with...your heroic tale.
Sure, count me in.
Good. Settled then.
This should be interesting. Mmm.
( Whistles)
Can l, uh... bum a smoke?
You'll want to tie those.
It's interesting.
Theyoung lady slips so suddenly
and you still had time
to removeyourjacket
and your shoes.
- ( Music BoxPlaying Tune)
- ( KnockAtDoor)
( DoorOpens)
I knowyou've been melancholy.
I don't pretend to know why.
I intended to save this
until the engagement gala
next week.
But I thought tonight.
Good gracious.
Perhaps as a reminder
of myfeelings foryou.
- Is it a...
- Diamond? Yes.
It was worn by Louis XVI
and they called it
"Le CoeurDeLa Mer. "
Both:
The Heart ofthe Ocean.
Yes.
It's overwhelming.
Well, it's for royalty.
We are royalty, Rose.
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't giveyou.
There's nothing I'd denyyou
ifyou would not deny me.
Now open your heart
to me, Rose.
Jack: Well, I've been on my own since
I was 1 5 since myfolks died.
And I had no
brothers or sisters
or close kin in that part
ofthe country.
So I lit on out ofthere
and I haven't been back since.
You couldjust call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.
Well, Rose...
we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck
and chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talkto me, is it?
- Mr. Dawson, l--
-Jack.
Jack...
I want to thankyou
forwhatyou did.
Notjust for... for pulling me back
but foryour discretion.
You're welcome.
Look, I know
whatyou must be thinking.
Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?
No. No, that's not what
I was thinking.
What I was thinking was
what could have happened to this girl
to make herthink
she had no way out?
Well, l--
It was everything.
It was mywhole world
and all the people in it
and the inertia of my life
plunging ahead
and me, powerless to stop it.
God! Look at that thing.
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.
All of Philadelphia society
will be there
and all the while
I feel I'm...
standing in the middle
ofa crowded room
screaming at the top of my lungs
and no one even looks up.
Doyou love him?
- Pardon me?
- Doyou love him?
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.
Well, it's a simple question.
Doyou love the guy or not?
This is not
a suitable conversation.
-Why can'tyoujust answerthe question?
-( Nervous Laughter)
This is absurd. You don't know me,
and I don't knowyou
and we are not having
this conversation at all.
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and I am leaving now.
Jack. Mr. Dawson,
it's been a pleasure.
I soughtyou out to thankyou
and now I have thanked you...
- And you've insulted me.
- Well,you deserved it.
- Right.
- Right.
- I thoughtyou were leaving.
- I am.
You are so annoying.
- ( Chuckles)
- Wait.
I don't have to leave.
This is my part ofthe ship. You leave.
Oh-ho-ho,
well, well, well.
Now who's being rude?
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?
So what areyou,
an artist or something?
Well, these are rather good.
They're, uh--
They're very good actually.
Jack, this is exquisite work.
They didn't thinktoo much
ofthem in old Paree.
Paris! You do get around
for a poor--
Well, uh, uh, a person
of limited means.
Go on, a poor guy,
you can say it.
Well, well, well.
And these were drawn from life?
Well, that's one
ofthe good things about Paris--
Iots ofgirls willing
to take their clothes off.
You liked this woman.
You used her several times.
Well, she had beautiful hands,
you see?
I thinkyou must have had
a love affairwith her.
No, no, no, no, no.
Just with her hands.
She was a one-legged prostitute.
See?
- ( Aghast): Oh!
- ( Both Chuckle)
Ah, she had a good sense
of humor, though.
Oh, and this lady...
she used to sit
at this bar every night
wearing every piece
ofjewelry she owned
just waiting
for her long-lost love.
Called her Madame Bijou.
See how her clothes
are all moth-eaten?
Well,you have a gift,Jack.
You do. You see people.
I seeyou.
And?
You wouldn't havejumped.
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.
Rose has already done that.
Look, here comes
that vulgar Brown woman.
Quickly, get up
before she sits with us.
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.
We're awfully sorry
you missed it.
The countess and I werejust off
to take the air on the boat deck.
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.
Molly:
Countess.
Soyou've notyet
lit the last four boilers?
No, I don't see the need.
We are making excellent time.
The press knows
the size of Titanic.
Now I want them to marvel
at her speed.
We must give them
something new to print.
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines
until they've been
properly run in.
Ofcourse
I'mjust a passenger.
I leave it toyour good offices
to decide what's best.
But what a glorious end
toyourfinal crossing
ifwe were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.
Make the morning papers.
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Good man.
Well, afterthat I worked on
a squid boat in Monterey.
Then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica
and started doing portraits there
forten cents apiece.
Why can't I be likeyou,Jack--
just head out forthe horizon
whenever I feel like it?
Saywe'll go there
sometime to that pier
even ifwe only
everjust talk about it.
No, we'll do it.
We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride
on the roller coastertill we throw up.
Then we'll ride horses on the beach
right in the surf.
Butyou'll have to do it like a real
cowboy. None ofthat sidesaddle stuff.
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.
- Can you show me?
- Sure... ifyou like.
- Teach me to ride like a man.
- And chew tobacco like a man.
And spit like a man.
They didn't teach you that
in finishing school?
- No.
- Well, come on, I'll showyou.
Let's do it.
I'll showyou how. Come on.
Jack, no!Jack, no!
Wait,Jack. No,Jack.
I couldn't possibly,Jack.
Watch closely.
- That's disgusting!
- All right,yourturn.
That was pitiful!
Come on,you really got
to hawk it back,you know?
Get some leverage to it.
Useyour arms, arcyour neck.
( Hawks)
- See the range on that thing?
- Mm-hmm.
- ( RoseHawking)
-Jack: Okay, go.
( Hawks)
-That was better. You got to work on it.
-Really?
Reallytry and hawk it up
and get some bodyto it,you know?
You got to...
( Snorting)
( Swallows)
Mother.
May I introduceJack Dawson?

The others were gracious
andcurious
abouttheman
who hadsavedmylife

a dangerous insect
which mustbesquashedquickly.
Well,Jack, sounds likeyou're a good
man to have around in a sticky spot.
( TrumpetPlayingFanfare)
Why do they always insist on announcing
dinner like a damn cavalry charge?
- ( Laughs)
- Shall we go to dress, Mother?
Seeyou at dinner,Jack.
Uh, son? Son!
Doyou have the slightest comprehension
whatyou're doing?
Not really.
Well,you're about to go
into the snake pit.
What areyou planning to wear?
I figured. Come on.
I was right.
You and my son
arejust about the same size.
Pretty close.
- ( Whistles)
- You shine up like a new penny.
( Laughs)
Good evening, sir.
( Orchestra Playing
"On TheBeautifuIBlueDanube")
Good evening.
Man:
Hello.
Cal: Doyou know that there are
several thousand tons
of Hockley steel
in this very ship?
- Ruth: Hmm. Which part?
- Cal: All the right ones, ofcourse.
Then we'll know who to hold
accountable ifthere's a problem.
- Where's my daughter?
- Oh, she'll be along.
- There is the countess.
- Hello, my dear.
- Good evening, Cal.
- Cal: So good to seeyou.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once
and I always wanted to do it.
( Snickers)
Ruth:
I'll seeyou at dinner.
Darling? Surely
you remember Mr. Dawson.
Dawson?
( Chuckles)
Well, it's amazing.
You could almost pass for a gentleman.
- Almost.
- Extraordinary.
Ruth:
My dear, it's delightful to seeyou.
What a remarkable
voyage this is.
- It's mad, isn't it?
- Ruth: I loveyour perfume.
There's the Countess of Rothes.
And, um, that'sJohnJacob Astor--
the richest man on the ship.
His little wifeythere, Madeleine,
is my age and in delicate condition.
See how she's
trying to hide it?
- Quite the scandal.
- Hmm.
And that's Benjamin Guggenheim
and his mistress Madame Aubert.
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home
with the children, ofcourse.
And over here we have
Sir Cosmo and Lucille Lady Duff-Gordon.
She designs naughty lingerie,
among her manytalents.
Very popularwith the royals.
Congratulations, Hockley.
She's splendid.
Why, thankyou.
- Care to escort a ladyto dinner?
- Certainly.
- ( Chuckling)
- Sweat pea?
- Cal: Sweet pea.
- Ain't nothin' to it, is there,Jack?
Remember, they love money, sojust
pretend likeyou own a gold mine...
and you're in the club.
- Hey, Astor!
- Well, hello, Molly. Nice to seeyou.
J.J. Madeleine,
I'd likeyou to meetJack Dawson.
- How doyou do?

in steerage, Mr. Dawson.
I hearthey're quite good
on this ship.
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.
( Laughter)
Mr. Dawson isjoining us
from the third class.
He was ofsome assistance
to myfiancee last night.
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.
He was kind enough to show me
some of his worktoday.
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition offine art.
Not to impugn yourwork, sir.
( Clears Throat)
Ismay:
She may be mine on paper
but in the eyes ofGod,
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.
( Whispering):
Are these all for me?
Just start from the outside
and workyourway in.
He knows every rivet
in her, don'tyou, Thomas?
- Your ship is a wonder, truly.
- Thankyou, Rose.
- And how doyou takeyour caviar, sir?
- No caviarfor me, thanks.
Never did like it much.
And where, exactly,
doyou live, Mr. Dawson?
Well, right now, my address
is the R.M.S. Titanic.
Afterthat,
I'm on God's good humor.
And how is it
you have means to travel?
I work myway
from place to place--
You know,
tramp steamers and such.
But I won myticket
on Titanic here
at a lucky hand at poker.
A very lucky hand.
- All life is a game of luck.
- Mmm.
A real man makes
his own luck, Archie.
- Right, Dawson?
- Mmm.
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing, doyou?
Well,yes, ma'am, I do.
I mean, got everything I need
right here with me.
Got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.
I mean, I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's going to happen
orwho I'm going to meet,
where I'm going to wind up.
Just the other night, I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now here I am
on the grandest ship in the world
having champagne with you fine people.
- ( Laughter)
- I'll take some more ofthat.
I figure life's a gift,
and I don't intend on wasting it.
You never know what hand
you're going to get dealt next.
You learn to take life
as it comes atyou. Hereyou go, Cal.
To make each day count.
- Well said,Jack.
- Hear, hear!
To making it count.
- All: To making it count.
- Archie: Bravo.
( MollyLaughing)
Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.
( Laughter)
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating and he lights a fire.
( Laughter)
( Softly): Next it'll be
brandies in the smoking room.
Archie:
Well,join me in a brandy, gentlemen?
( MenAgree)
Now they retreat into a cloud ofsmoke
and congratulate each other
on being masters ofthe universe.
Ladies, thankyou for
the pleasure ofyour company.
Rose, may I escortyou
backto the cabin?
- No, I'll stay here.
- Hereyou go, Molly.
Archie:
Joining us, Dawson?
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, doyou?
No, thanks.
I've got to be heading back.
- Ah.
- Probably best.
It'll be all business
and politics, that sort ofthing--
Wouldn't interestyou.
But Dawson, good ofyou to come.
Jack, mustyou go?
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

Go see Maggie, lads.
Give herthe holley! Let's go!
Musicians:
Ho!
Coffee, sir?
I had hoped you would
come to me last night.
I was tired.
Your exertions below decks
were no doubt exhausting.
I seeyou had that undertaker
ofa manservant follow me. How typical.
You will never behave like that
again, Rose. Doyou understand?
I'm not a foreman in one
ofyour mills thatyou can command.
I'm yourfiancee.
Myfiancee?
Myfiancee?!!
Yes,you are, and mywife!
Mywife in practice if notyet by law,
soyou will honor me.
You will honor me the way a wife
is required to honor a husband.
Because I will not be
made out a fool, Rose.
Is this in anyway unclear?
- No.
- Good.
Excuse me.
Miss Rose!
- We had a little... accident.
- That's all right, Miss Rose.
- That's all right.
- I'm sorry, Trudy.
Let me helpyou.
It's all right, miss.
It's all right, miss.
- Tea, Trudy.
- Yes, ma'am.
You're not to see that boy again,
doyou understand me?
- Rose, I forbid it.
- Oh, stop it, Mother.
You'll giveyourself
a nosebleed.
This is not a game.
Our situation is precarious.
You know the money's gone.
Ofcourse I know it's gone.
You remind me every day.
Yourfather left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.
That name is the only card
we have to play.
I don't understand you.
It is a fine match with Hockley.
- It will ensure our survival.
- How can you put this on my shoulders?
- Why areyou being so selfish?
- I'm being selfish?
Doyou want to see me
working as a seamstress?
Is that whatyou want?
To see ourfine things
sold at auction?
Our memories
scattered to the winds?
( Sighs)
It's so unfair.
Ofcourse it's unfair.
We're women.
Our choices are never easy.
Hmm?

- I need to talkto somebodyfor a sec.
You're not supposed

I wasjust here last night.
You don't remember me?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
Nowyou're going to have to turn around.
He'll tell you.
I just-- I just need--
Mr. Hockley
and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater
continue to be appreciative
ofyour assistance.
They asked me to, uh...
giveyou this in gratitude.
- I don't wantyour money. Please, l--
- And also to remind you...
thatyou hold
a third-class ticket
and thatyour presence here
is no longer appropriate.
Please, I just want
to speakto Rose for--
Gentlemen, will you please see that
Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs
and that he stays there?
Yes, sir.
Come along,you.
" Oh, hear us
when we cryto Thee "
" Forthose in peril
on the sea. "
Ruth: And why doyou have
two steering wheels?
We really only use
this near shore.
Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning.
This one's from the Noordam.
Thankyou, Sparks.
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal forthis time ofyear.
In fact, we're speeding up.
I'vejust ordered
the last boilers lit.
Man: Okay, son,
wind it up tight like I showed you.
Okay, now, let it go.
- Was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice.
That's excellent, son.
Rose:
Mr. Andrews, forgive me...
I did the sum in my head
and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacityyou mentioned
forgive me, but it seems that there
are not enough for everyone aboard.
About half, actually.
Rose,you miss nothing, doyou?
ln fact, I put in these new type davits
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one
but it was thought by some
that the deckwould looktoo cluttered
so I was overruled.
Waste ofdeck space as it is
on an unsinkable ship.
Sleep soundly,young Rose. I have built
you a good ship, strong and true.
She's all the lifeboatyou need.
Just keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.
Come on.
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't seeyou.
- I need to talktoyou.
- No,Jack, no.
Jack, I'm engaged.
I'm marrying Cal.
I love Cal.
Rose,you're no picnic.
All right,you're a spoiled
little brat, even
but underthatyou're the most
amazingly astounding
wonderful girl-- woman--
that I've ever known and...
-Jack, l...
- No, let me try and get this out.
You're,you're ama--
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.
I have nothing to offeryou
and I know that.
I understand.
But I'm too involved now.
Youjump, I jump, remember?
I can't turn away
without knowingyou'll be all right.
That's all that I want.
Well, I'm fine.
I'll be fine, really.
Really?
I don't think so.
They've gotyou trapped, Rose
and you're going to die
ifyou don't breakfree--
Maybe not right away
becauseyou're strong, but
sooner or laterthat fire
that I love aboutyou, Rose...
that fire is going to burn out.
It's not up toyou
to save me,Jack.
You're right.
Onlyyou can do that.
I'm going back.
Leave me alone.
Countess: Tell Lucille about the
disasteryou had with the stationer's.
Well, ofcourse, the invitations
had to be sent back twice.
- Oh, my dear!
- And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--
Let me tell you what an odyssey
that has been.
Rose decided
she wanted lavender.
She knows I detest the color,
so she did it onlyto spite me.
Lucille:
lfonlyyou'd come to me sooner.
Ruth saw some of my designs
in "La Mode Illustree."
Theywere forTrousseau ofthe Duchess
of Malborough'syoungest daughter.
Theywere quite charming, but I think
you'll agree, my dear, that together
we've created something ofa phoenix
from the ashes.
( Women Laugh Politely)
Hello,Jack.
I changed my mind.
- They said you might be--
- Shh.
Give meyour hand.
Now closeyour eyes.
Go on.
Step up.
Now hold on to the railing.
- Keepyour eyes closed, don't peek.
- I'm not.
Step up onto the rail.
Hold on. Hold on.
Keepyour eyes closed.
- ( Giggles)
- Doyou trust me?
I trustyou.
All right, open your eyes.
I'm flying!Jack!

" Going up, she goes "

That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.
So we're up to dusk
the night ofthe sinking.
- Six hours to go.
- Incredible.
There's Smith and he's standing there
and he's got the iceberg warning...
in his fucking hand-- excuse me--
his hand, and he's ordering more speed.
working against him.
He figures anything big enough
to sinkthe ship
they're going to see
in time to turn
but the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.
Doesn't cornerworth a damn.
Everything he knows is wrong.
( Laughing)
It's quite proper, I assureyou.
This is the sitting room.
- Will this light do?
- What?
Don't artists need good light?
( ln French Accent):
That is true
but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.
Monet!
- Doyou know his work?
- Ofcourse.
Look at his use ofcolor here.
Isn't he great?
I know, it's extraordinary.
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.
- That's nice.
- What is it, a sapphire?
A diamond,
a very rare diamond.
Jack, I wantyou to draw me like one
ofyour French girls... wearing this.
All right.
Wearing onlythis.
The last thing I need
is another picture of me
Iooking like a porcelain doll.
As a paying customer...
I expect to get what I want.
Over on the bed--
the couch.
Go... Iie down.
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Putyour arm backthe way it was.
Right.
Put that other arm up,
that hand right byyourface there.
Right.
Now, head down.
Eyes to me,
keep them on me.
And tryto stay still.
( Exhales)
So serious.
I believeyou are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.
He does landscapes.
Just relaxyourface.
- Sorry.
- No laughing.
( Exhales)
My heart was pounding
the whole time.
It was the most erotic moment
of my life.
Up until then, at least.
- So what happened next?
- You mean, did we do it?
Sorry, to disappointyou,
Mr. Bodine.
Jackwas very professional.
Thankyou.
( RoseLaughing)
Whatyou doing?
Will you put this back
in the safe for me?
Mm-hmm.
Would you excuse me?
- None ofthe stewards have seen her.
- This is absurd.
It's a ship, there's only
so many places she could be.
Lovejoy, find her.
- Clear.
- Yes.
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.
Like a mill pond.
Not a breath ofwind.
It will make the bergs
harderto see
with no breaking water
at the base.
Hmm.
Well, I'm off. Maintain speed
and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
Yes, sir.
It's getting cold.
You look nice.

- Lovejoy: Miss Rose?
My drawings!
( DoorCloses)
Come on!
- No, wait, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait!
Go, go! Down, down!
Rose:
Quickly, quickly!
( Giggling)
Bye!
- Sorry!
- ( Giggling)
- It's all right!
- ( Laughing)
Prettytough for a valet,
this fellow.
- Seems more like a cop.
- I think he was.
-Jack: Oh, shit.
- ( RoseScreams)
No, over here!
Quick!
( BoilerBlasting)
- Now what?!
- What?!
Hold up! What'reyou two
doing down here?
You shouldn't be down here!
It could be dangerous!
Jack: Carry on! Don't mind us.
You're doing a greatjob!
Keep up the good work!
Ah, lookwhat
we have here, huh?
( Rose Clears Throat)
Thankyou.
- ( Honks Horn )
- Where to, miss?
To the stars.
You nervous?
No.
Putyour hands on me,Jack.
Crewman:
God, it's bloody cold.
You know, I can smell ice,
you know, when it's near.
- Bollocks.
- But I can, all right!
Murdoch: Did you everfind
those binoculars forthe lookouts?
Haven't seen them
since Southampton.
Well, I'll be on my rounds.
Cheerio.
You're trembling.
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.
- They ran down there.
- Right.
Lovejoy:
Anything missing?
I've got a better idea.
Gotcha!
( RoseLaughing)
( Laughing)
Did you see those guys' faces?
Did you see the...
When the ship docks...
I'm getting offwith you.
This is crazy.
I know.
It doesn't make any sense.
That's why I trust it.
( Quietly):
Oh,yes. Here, look at this.
Oh, look at that, would you?
- They're a bit warmerthan we are.
- Well, ifthat's what it takes
for us to get warmer I'd rather not,
if it's all the same toyou.

( Softly): Oh, my God.
That was a close shave, weren't it?
Smell ice, can you?
Bleeding Christ.
Note the time
and enter it in the log.
What was that, Mr. Murdoch?
An iceberg, sir.
I put her hard to starboard
and ran the engines full astern
but it was too close.
I tried to port round it
but she hit and the...
- Close the watertight doors.
- Murdoch: The doors are closed, sir.
- All stop.
- Crewman: Aye, sir!
( Ringing)
Find the carpenter.
Get him to sound the ship.
Yes, sir!
Fabrizio:
Porca puttana!
Che cazzo e?
Come on, let's get the hell
out of here! Come on, hurry up.
Excuse me. Why have the engines stopped?
I felt a shudder.
I shouldn't worry, madam.
We've likelythrown a propeller blade.
That's the shudderyou felt.
May I bringyou anything?
No, thankyou.
Man:
Did you see anything?
Man:
I don't see anything now, doyou?
( Commotion)
Ifthis is the direction the rats
are going that's good enough for me.
Crewman: Please, sir, please.
Everything's under control.
- You there.
- Sir, there is no emergency.
- Yes, there is, I have been robbed.
- Get the master-at-arms.
- Now,you moron!
- Yes, sir.
( Men Laughing)
Hey,you're going to miss the fun.
Did you see what happened?
No, I missed it.
Apparently, it hit overthere.
Crewman: Boiler room six
is flooded eight feet above the plate.
And the mail hold is worse. She's
all buckled in in the forward hold.
- Can you shore up?
- Not unless the pumps get ahead.
Haveyou seen the damage
in the mail hold?
- No, she's already underwater.
- This is bad.
We should tell
Mother and Cal.
I thinkthey're very good, sir.
Don't touch anything.
I want the entire room photographed.
Rose:
Just keep holding my hand.
We've been looking
foryou, miss.
Rose ( Sighs):
Well, here we go.
Something serious has happened.
Yes, it has.
Indeed. Two things dearto me
have disappeared this evening.
Now that one is back I have a pretty
good idea where to find the other.
- Search him.
- Takeyour coat off, sir.
- Now what?
- Come on.
Cal, what areyou doing? We're in the
middle ofan emergency. What's going on?
- Is this it?
- That's it.
This is horseshit!
- Don'tyou believe it, Rose. Don't!
- He couldn't have.
Ofcourse he could.
It's easy enough for a professional.
But I was with him the whole time.
This is absurd.
Perhaps he did it whileyou were putting
your clothes back on, dear.
Real slick, Cal.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.
- Shut up.
- It isn't even your pocket, is it, son?
Property ofA. L. Ryerson.
- That was reported stolen today.
- I just borrowed it.
- I was going to return it.
- We have an honest thief here, do we?
You know I didn't do this, Rose.
You know it.
Don'tyou believe them, Rose.
You know I didn't do it.
- Come on, let's go.
- You know I didn't do it, Rose. Rose!
Come on, son.
There's a good lad.
- Come on.
- You know I didn't do it! You know me!
Ismay:
Most unfortunate, Captain.
Water... 1 4 feet above
the keel in ten minutes--
In the forepeak, in all three holds
and in the boiler room six.
- That's right, sir.
- When can we get underway, damn it?
That's five compartments.
She can stay afloat with the first
four compartments breached
but not five-- not five.
As she goes down bythe head
the water
will spill overthe tops of bulkheads
at E deckfrom one to the next.
Back and back.
There's no stopping it.
The pumps--
Ifwe opened the doors--
The pumps buyyou time,
but minutes only.
From this moment,
no matterwhat we do
Titanicwill founder.
But this ship can't sink.
She's made of iron, sir.
I assureyou, she can...
and she will.
It is a mathematical certainty.
How much time?
An hour. Two at most.
And how many aboard,
Mr. Murdoch?
Well, I believeyou may get
your headlines, Mr. Ismay.
Oh, it is a little slut, isn't it? Will
you look at me when I'm talking toyou.
( KnockAtDoor)
- Mr. Hockley?
- Not now, we're busy.
Sir, I've been told to askyou to please
put on your lifebelts and come up to--
I said not now.
I'm sorryto inconvenienceyou,
Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.
Now, please, dress warmly.
It's quite cold out tonight.
Now, may I suggest
topcoats and hats.
- This is ridiculous.
- Not to worry, miss.
I am sure
it'sjust a precaution.

That's right-- C.QD.

- Hey, sonny, what's doing?
You got us all trussed up here
and now we're cooling our heels.
Sorry, ma'am.
Let me go and find out.
I don't think anybody knows
what the hell's going on around here.
It's the goddamned English
doing everything bythe book.
There's no need for language,
Mr. Hockley.
Go back and turn
the heaters on in our rooms.
I'd like a cup oftea
when I return.
Yes, ma'am.
Mr. Andrews.
I saw the iceberg
and I see it in your eyes.
Please tell me the truth.
The ship will sink.
- You're certain.
- Yes, in an hour or so....
all this will be
at the bottom ofthe Atlantic.
- What?
- Please, tell onlywhoyou must?
I don't want to
be responsible for a panic
and get to a boat quickly,
don't wait.
You rememberwhat I told you
about the boats?
Yes.
I understand.
Over here, sir.
Sir, they need you
up in the second-class purser's office.
- There's a big mob up there.
- Go on, I'll keep an eye on him.
Aye, right.
Sir! Carpathia says
they're making 1 7 knots.
Full steam forthem, sir.
She's the only one responding?
The only one close, sir.
She says they can be here in four hours.
Four hours?
Thankyou, Bride.
( Softly):
My God.
( Crewmen Yelling OutOrders)
Sir! We are swung out
and ready, sir.
Hadn't we better get the women
and children into the boat, sir?
- Yes, we do.
- Sir?
Women and children first. Yes.
Yes, sir.
Crewman ( Yelling): Ladies
and gentlemen,your attention please!
Step this way, please.
That's right.
Come towards me.
Thankyou. Good.
Forthe time being, I shall require
onlywomen and children.

Right here.
All right, boys,

Please stay calm.
Look, please, make sure, everybody,
you've gotyour lifebelts on

and children through to the front.
- What are we doing, Mommy?
- We'rejust waiting, dear.
When they're finished putting
the first-class people in the boats...
they'll start with us and
we'll want to be all ready, won't we?

Mr. Caledon Hockley.
Come on, sister,you heard
the man-- into the boat.
Any room for a gentleman,
gentlemen?
Crewman:
Onlywomen at this time, sir.
Will the lifeboats be seated
according to class?
I hope they're
not too crowded.
Oh, Mother, shut up!
Don'tyou understand? The water is
freezing and there aren't enough boats.
Not enough by half. Halfthe people
on this ship are going to die.
Not the better half.
Come on, Ruth, get in the boat.
First-class seats are right up here.
You know, it's a pity
I didn't keep that drawing.
It'll be worth
a lot more by morning.

Good-bye, Mother.

Madam, please put on a lifebelt.
Get to the boat deck immediately.
Lucy, for God's sake,
put on your lifebelt.
- Set a good example.
- Yes, sir.
- Anyone in here?
- Mr. Andrews? Mr. Andrews, thank God.
Where would the master-at-arms
take someone under arrest?
What? You have to get
to a boat right away.
No! I'm doing this with orwithoutyour
help, sir, but without will take longer.
Take the elevatorto the bottom. Go
to the left down the crewman's passage.
Then go right and left again at the
stairs. You'll come to a long corridor.

I didn't.

We're cIear.
Have fun in Punxsutawney.
For your information, Hairdo,
a major network is interested in me.
That wouId be the
Home Shopping Network.
Thanks, Larry.
Go wait in the van.
That was nice, PhiI.
'' Big trees'' !
Stop, Kenny.
Look, can you handIe
the 1 0:00 or not?
If you don't want to rush back,
I can do the 5:00 tomorrow.
Stay an extra second in Punxsutawney?
PIease!
Rita thinks it'd be
a great idea...
...to stay for other events.
You'II get incredibIe footage.
The peopIe and the fun.
The excitement!
You haven't worked with her yet.
She's reaIIy nice.
I think she'II be
a reaIIy good producer.
You guys are going to have fun.
She's fun. But not my kind of fun.
I'II be here for the 5:00.
Can you keep a secret, Larry?
I'm probabIy Ieaving PBH.
So this wiII be the Iast time...
...we do the Groundhog together.
What's wrong with
the Groundhog FestivaI?
In San Diego...
...I covered the swaIIows returning
to Capistrano for six years.
Someone wiII see me interview
a groundhog and think I have no future.
I think it's a nice story.
He comes out.
He Iooks around.
He wrinkIes up his nose.
He sees his shadow or not.
It's nice! PeopIe Iike it!
You are new, aren't you?
PeopIe Iike bIood sausage too.
PeopIe are morons!
Nice attitude.
Look in the mirror and see how you
Iook when you do that groundhog thing.
For me? Once?
He comes out, and there he
Iooks at his IittIe shadow.
Want some bIood sausage?
I have some--
I Iike bIood sausage.
Rita, I can't stay here.
Prima donna.
-What's the matter?
-I hate this pIace.
I stayed here two years ago.
I was miserabIe.
-I won't stay here.
-You're not staying here.
I'm not?
Larry's dropping me off.
I booked you in
a nice bed and breakfast.
Great.
I think this is one of the traits
of a good producer.
Keep the taIent happy.
Anything I can do.
WouId you heIp me
with my peIvic tiIt?
Within reason. Want to come
to dinner with Larry and me?
No, thank you.
I've seen Larry eat.
You get your sIeep.
See you in the morning.
Don't be Iate.
Did he actuaIIy caII himseIf
''the taIent''?
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day!
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!
Expect hazardous travel
later today with...
... that blizzard thing.
That blizzard thing.
Here's the report.
The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.
There's another reason
today's especially ex citing--
Especially cold.
The big question
on everybody's lips--
-Their chapped lips.
-On their chapped lips.
Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?
-Punxsutawney Phil!
-That's right, woodchuck chuckers!
It's Groundhog Day!
Get up and chuck me a hog!
-Morning!
-Morning.
-Off to see the groundhog?
-I am.
Think it'II be an earIy spring?
I'm predicting March 21 st.
Good guess!
I think that actuaIIy is
the first day of spring.
-Did you sIeep weII, Mr. Connors?
-I sIept aIone, Mrs. Lancaster.
Like some coffee?
Is there any possibiIity of getting
an espresso or cappuccino?
I reaIIy don't know....
How to speII espresso or cappuccino.
This Iooks fine.
I hope you enjoy the festivities.
-I'm sure I wiII.
-There's taIk of a bIizzard.
We may catch a break and
it wiII bIow right by.
The moisture coming
out of the south...
...by midday wiII
push on to the east.
At high aItitudes it'II crystaIIize
and give us what we caII snow.
Our high wiII get to
about 30 today, teens tonight.
Chance of precipitation,
about 20%/% today, 20%/% tomorrow.
Did you want to taIk about
the weather or just chitchat?
Chitchat.
See you Iater.
WiII you be checking out today?
Chance of departure today, 1 00%/%.
PhiI Connors!
I thought that was you!
How you doing?
Thanks for watching.
Don't teII me you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.
Not a chance.
Ned!
Ryerson!
NeedIenose Ned.
Ned the Head.
Come on, buddy,
Case Western High!
I did the whistIing beIIybutton
trick at the taIent show.
Bing! Got the shingIes reaI bad
senior year. AImost didn't graduate.
Bing again!
I dated your sister a coupIe times
tiII you toId me not to anymore.
WeII?
Ned Ryerson?
Bing!
Bing.
Did you turn pro with
that beIIybutton thing?
I seII insurance.
-What a shock.
-Do you have insurance?
If you do, you couId
aIways use more.
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?
I wouId Iove to stand here
and taIk with you.
But I'm not going to.
See you.
That's aII right!
I'II waIk with you.
I see an opportunity,
I charge it Iike a buII.
Ned the BuII, that's me now.
I got friends who Iive and die
by the actuariaI tabIes.
I say it's aII one big
crapshoot anyhoo.
Ever heard of singIe-premium Iife?
That couId be the ticket for you.
Oh, God!
It is so good to see you!
What are you doing for dinner?
Something eIse.
It's been great seeing you,
NeedIehead. Take care.
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!
PhiI!
PhiI, over here!
Where have you been?
It was horribIe.
A giant Ieech got me.
You're missing aII the fun.
These peopIe are great!
Some of them partied aII night.
They sing tiII they get coId.
Then they go sit by the fire
and get warm.
Then they come back
and sing some more!
They're hicks, Rita.
So did you sIeep okay without me?
You tossed and turned, didn't you?
You're incredibIe.
Who toId you?
It's groundhog time.
Okay.
On me in three...
...two, one.
Once a year, the eyes of the nation
turn to this tiny hamIet...
...to watch a master at work.
The master?
Punxsutawney PhiI...
...the worId's most famous weatherman.
The groundhog.
Who, as Iegend has it,
can predict an earIy spring.
The question we have
to ask ourseIves is:
'' Does PhiI feeI Iucky?''
Every year, the guy comes with
a big stick and raps on the door.
They puII the IittIe rat out,
taIk to him.
The rat taIks back.
Then they teII us when it'II end.
Isn't he cute?
Do you Iike the guys
with the prominent upper teeth?
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...
...Punxsutawney PhiI...
...the seer of seers...
...prognosticator of prognosticators...
...emerged reIuctantIy...
...but aIertIy...
...in Punxsutawney, PA...
...and stated in groundhog-ese...
...'' I definiteIy see a shadow.''
Sorry, foIks.
Six more weeks of winter.
On me in three...
...two, one.
This is one time where
teIevision faiIs...
...to capture the excitement
of a Iarge squirreI...
...predicting the weather.
I'm gratefuI to have been here.
From Punxsutawney...
...this is PhiI Connors.
So Iong.
Want to try it again
without the sarcasm?
We got it.
I'm out of here.
Prima donnas.
Oh, boy.
Take a Iook at this.
What is going on?
I don't know. Perhaps that
bIizzard we're not supposed to get.
This is impossibIe.
Nobody honks this horn but me,
okay, paI?
Take it out of here.
Commander, what's going on?
Nothing.
We're cIosing the road.
-Big bIizzard moving in.
-It's a coupIe of fIakes.
Don't you Iisten to the weather?
I make the weather.
AII this moisture from the GuIf
wiII push off to the east in AItoona.
You got that moisture on your head.
You can go back to Punxsutawney...
...or you can freeze to death.
It's your choice.
So, what's it going to be?
I'm thinking.
Come on, aII the Iong-distance
Iines are down?
What about the sateIIite?
Is it snowing in space?
Don't you keep a Iine open
for emergencies or ceIebrities?
I'm both.
I'm a ceIebrity in an emergency.
Can you patch me through
on that Iine?
CouId I have one more of these
with some booze in it?
I Iike it here.
Going to the groundhog dinner?
No, I had groundhog for Iunch.
Wasn't bad.
Tastes Iike chicken.
You two run aIong.
Looking foxy tonight, man.
Is your troop seIIing
cookies again this year?
That's so funny.
So, what are you doing?
I think I'II go back to my room...
...take a hot shower
and maybe read Hustler.
Suit yourseIf.
Yo, mom.
Isn't there any hot water?
Oh, no, there wouIdn't be today.
Of course not.
SiIIy me.
Sweet dreams.
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day!
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!
Nice going, boys.
You're pIaying yesterday's tape.
--with that blizzard thing.
That blizzard thing?
Here's the report.
The National Weather Service
is calling for a big blizzard thing.
There's another reason
today's especially ex citing--
Especially cold.
The big question
on everybody's lips--
-Chapped Iips.
-Their chapped lips.
Will Phil come out
and see his shadow?
-Punxsutawney Phil!
-That's right, woodchuck chuckers!
It's Groundhog Day!
Get up and chuck me a hog!
What the heII?
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?
Think it'II be an earIy spring?
Didn't we do this yesterday?
I don't know what you mean.
Don't mess with me, Pork Chop!
-What day is this?
-It's February 2nd.
Groundhog Day.
I'm sorry.
I thought it was yesterday.
Did you sIeep weII, Mr. Connors?
Did I sIeep weII?
Like some coffee?
Yes, pIease.
I think I'II have a doubIe.
I hope you enjoy the festivities.
There's taIk of a bIizzard.
Ever have deja vu,
Mrs. Lancaster?
I'II check with the kitchen.
That's okay.
Thank you.
WiII you be checking out today?
I'd say the chance
of departure is 80 percent.
Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Where's everybody going?
To GobbIer's Knob.
It's Groundhog Day.
It's stiII just once a year,
isn't it?
PhiI Connors!
I thought that was you!
My, oh my, PhiI Connors!
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you.
-WeII?
-Ned Ryerson?
Bing! First shot
right out of the box!
So how's it going, oId buddy?
I'm not feeIing weII.
WouId you excuse me?
It's funny you shouId mention
your heaIth. Guess what I do now.
Do you seII insurance?
Bing again!
You are sharp as a tack today!
Do you have Iife insurance?
If you do, you couId
aIways use more.
Right! I mean, who couIdn't?
But you want to know something?
I gots a feeIing...
...you ain't got any.
Am I right or am I right
or am I right?
I got to go.
Watch out for that first step.
It's a doozy!
PhiI! Over here!
-Where have you been?
-Rita. Do me a favour.
I need someone to give me a
good, hard sIap in the face.
How's that?
Good!
If you need heIp with the other cheek,
I'm right here.
Something's going on.
-Are you drunk or something?
-Drunk's more fun.
Can I be serious with you
for a minute?
Can you?
I'm being serious!
I'm having a probIem.
I may be having a probIem.
It's groundhog time.
See? I knew you'd say that!
I reaIIy feeI...
...weird.
Let's just do this.
Then we'II taIk.
AII right, on me in three...
...two, one.
WeII, it's Groundhog Day...
...again...
...and that must mean we're
up here at GobbIer's Knob...
...waiting for the worId's most famous
groundhogIweatherman...
...Punxsutawney PhiI...
...who's about to teII us how much more
winter to expect.
This is a riot!
Isn't he cute?
This February 2nd, at 7:20
and 30 seconds...
...Punxsutawney PhiI,
the seer of seers...
...prognosticator of prognosticators...
...emerged reIuctantIy...
...but aIertIy in Punxsu--
Oh, my gosh!
I know there's a bIizzard.
When wiII the Iong-distance
Iines be repaired?
What if there is no tomorrow?
There wasn't one today.
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?
Did you sIeep weII, Mr.--
PhiI Connors! I thought--
Don't say you don't remember me.
I sure as heckfire remember you!
It's me, Ned! Ryerson!
NeedIenose Ned! Ned the Head!
PhiI! Over here!
Can I taIk to you?
It's not work-reIated.
-You never taIk about work.
-We have to taIk.
-It's a creative meeting.
-We've got work to do!
I don't.
I've aIready done it twice.
When you get finished,
meet me in the diner.
-What's that aII about?
-I don't know.
Prima donnas.
More coffee?
Just the check, pIease.
These sticky buns are heaven.
Aren't they?
Just put that anywhere, paI!
Good save!
TeII me why you're too sick to work.
It better be good.
I'm reIiving the same day
over and over.
Groundhog Day. Today.
Okay. I'm waiting for the punch Iine.
ReaIIy! This is the third time!
It's Iike yesterday never happened!
I'm racking my brain trying to imagine
why you'd make this up.
I'm not making it up.
I'm asking for heIp!
What do you want me to do?
I don't know! You're a producer.
Come up with something.
You shouId get
your head examined...
...if you expect me to beIieve
a stupid story Iike that!
PhiI? Like the groundhog PhiI?
Yeah. Like the groundhog PhiI.
Look out for your shadow, paI!
Morons, your bus is Ieaving!
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.
-Let's taIk about it in Pittsburgh.
-I'm not going back to Pittsburgh.
-Why not?
-Because of the bIizzard!
You said it was going
to hit AItoona.
I know that's what I said.
I think you need heIp.
That's what I've been saying.
I need heIp.
No spots.
No cIots, no tumours.
No Iesions.
No aneurisms.
At Ieast none that I can see.
If you want a CAT scan or an MRI,
you'II have to go into Pittsburgh.
I can't go into Pittsburgh.
-Why can't you go into Pittsburgh?
-I toId you, there's a bIizzard.
Right. The bIizzard!
You know what you may need,
Mr. Connors?
A biopsy.
A psychiatrist.
That's an unusuaI probIem...
...Mr. Connors.
Most of my work is with coupIes,
famiIies. I have an aIcohoIic now.
You went to coIIege, right?
It wasn't veterinary
psychoIogy, was it?
Didn't you take a course that
covered this stuff?
Sort of, I guess.
AbnormaI psychoIogy.
So...
...what do I do?
We shouId meet again.
How's tomorrow for you?
Is that not good?
I was in the Virgin IsIands once.
I met a girI.
We ate Iobster.
Drank pina coIadas.
At sunset, we made Iove
Iike sea otters.
That was a pretty good day.
Why couIdn't I get that day...
...over...
...and over and over?
Some guys wouId Iook
at this gIass and say:
''That gIass is haIf empty.''
Other guys wouId say,
''That gIass is haIf fuII.''
I peg you as a ''gIass is haIf empty''
kind of guy. Right?
What wouId you do if you were
stuck in one pIace...
...and every day was exactIy the same,
and nothing you did mattered?
That about sums it up for me.
Good Iuck.
I'II drop you off.
This thing sticks a IittIe bit.
You got to jiggIe it--
Come on up here, paI.
Give me your keys, paI.
Give me the keys.
Friends don't Iet friends drive, right?
Stand up here.
Take a deep breath. You feeI okay?
You're aII right.
You want to throw up here
or in the car?
I think, both.
I don't think I shouId drive.
I don't either.
Watch your head.
Watch your knees.
Don't break anything.
Let's not forget seat beIts.
Who eIse couId go for some
fIapjacks right now?
Let me ask you a question.
Shoot.
What if there were no tomorrow?
No tomorrow? That means there'd be
no consequences...
...no hangovers.
We couId do whatever we wanted!
That's true.
We couId do whatever we want.
If we wanted to hit maiIboxes
we couId Iet RaIph drive!
They want you to stop.
Hang on!
It's the same thing
your whoIe Iife.
'' CIean up your room! Stand up
straight! Pick up your feet!
Take it Iike a man!
Be nice to your sister!
Don't mix beer and wine, ever!
Don't drive on the raiIroad tracks!''
That's one I agree with.
I don't know, Gus.
Sometimes I think you just have to...
...take the big chances.
This is the police! Pull over now!
We're taIking in here!
I bet he swerves first.
I'm not going to Iive by
their ruIes anymore!
I noticed that.
You make choices
and you Iive with them.
My knee!
Let me handIe this.
Three cheeseburgers,
two Iarge fries...
...two chocoIate shakes
and one Iarge Coke.
And some fIapjacks!
Too earIy for fIapjacks?
Yes!
Rise and shine, campers!
Don't forget your booties!
It's coId out there today!
It's coId every day.
What is this, Miami Beach?
Not hardIy!
SIept Iike a baby.
I'd Iove some of your coffee.
-I hope--
-FIurries moving in Iater...
...but the bIizzard's going to hit
outside of town.
Mrs. Lancaster?
Was anybody Iooking for me
here this morning?
Perhaps a state officiaI?
Maybe a bIue hat, gun, nightstick?
No, no one Iike that!
WiII there be?
ApparentIy not.
WiII you hoId my room for me?
I'm staying an extra day.
Catch you tomorrow, pops.
-PhiI Connors!
-Ned?
I Iike to see a man of advancing years
throw caution to the wind.
It's inspiring, in a way.
My years are not advancing
as fast as you think.
More coffee?
Keep it coming.
Sure thing.
Just put that anywhere, paI!
Good save!
Don't you worry about choIesteroI,
Iung cancer, Iove handIes?
I don't worry anymore.
What makes you speciaI?
Everybody worries.
That's exactIy what makes me
so speciaI.
I don't even have to fIoss.
What?
''The wretch, concentred aII in seIf
'' Living, shaII forfeit fair renown
''And doubIy dying, shaII go down
''To the viIe dust from whence he sprung
'' Unwept...
'' ...unhonoured and unsung''
Sir WaIter Scott.
You don't Iike poetry?
I Iove poetry!
I just thought that was WiIIard Scott.
I was confused.
You think I act Iike this
because I'm egocentric?
You are egocentric.
It's your defining characteristic.
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.
Thanks, Larry.
WouId you Iike a doggie bag?
I'II stay and finish.
I thought you hated this town.
It's beginning to grow on me.
Larry, quit staring.
-These are exceIIent.
-Bon appetit.
You see the groundhog
this morning?
I never miss it.
What's your name?
Nancy TayIor. And you are?
-What high schooI did you go to?
-What?
High schooI.
LincoIn, in Pittsburgh.
Who are you?
Who was your 1 2th grade
EngIish teacher?
Are you kidding?
In 1 2th grade,
your EngIish teacher was--
Mrs. WaIsh.
Nancy. LincoIn. WaIsh.
Thanks very much.
Nancy?
Nancy TayIor!
LincoIn High SchooI!
I sat next to you in
Mrs. WaIsh's EngIish cIass!
-I'm sorry.
-PhiI Connors!
-That's amazing!
-You don't remember me?
I asked you to the prom.
PhiI Connors?
I was short and I've sprouted.
How are you?
Great.
You Iook terrific!
You Iook very, very terrific!
Listen, I got to go do this report.
Are you a reporter?
A weatherman with
ChanneI 9, Pittsburgh.
I shouId have known! That's great!
But maybe Iater we couId....
Yeah, whatever!
Stay right here.
Promise me?
I'II be right back. Wish me Iuck!
Good Iuck!
Oh, PhiI.
Oh, Rita.
Who's Rita?
How shouId I know?
What is this,
some kind of one-night stand?
On the contrary, Nancy...
...I Iove you.
I've aIways Ioved you.
This is going to seem sudden but...
...Nancy, wiII you be my wife?
Rita.
-Nancy.
-Whatever.
A gust of wind.
A dog barks.
Cue the truck.
Exit Herman.
WaIk on to the bank.
Exit FeIix, and stand there with a
not-so-bright Iook on your face.
AII right, Doris. Come on.
Fix your bra, honey.
That's better.
FeIix!
How you doing, Doris?
Can I have a roII of quarters?
Ten...nine...eight...
...car...
...six...five...
...quarters...
...three...two....
FeIix?
-Did I bring out two bags or one?
-I don't know.
I thought we were going
to a costume party.
It's Iike I said, I Iove this fiIm.
I've seen it over 1 00 times.
PhiI!
ToId you...
...caII me '' Bronco.''
Sorry, Bronco.
Hi, Nancy.
My own fiancee...
...doesn't remember me.
That'II be one aduIt and--
-Two aduIts.
-Two aduIts, I guess.
--groundhog who, as legend has it,
can predict an early spring.
The question we have
to ask ourselves today is.:
''Does Phil feel lucky?''
Rita, if you onIy
had one day to Iive...
...what wouId you do?
I don't know.
What are you dying of?
No, the whoIe worId
is about to expIode.
What do you do?
I want to know
where to put the camera.
What are you Iooking for?
A date for the weekend?
No, I'm just interested in you.
What do you want?
What do you Iike?
What do you think about?
What kind of men
are you interested in?
What do you do for fun?
Are you trying to
make me Iook Iike a fooI?
I'm trying to taIk Iike normaI peopIe.
Isn't this how they taIk?
-CIose.
-Okay, so taIk to me.
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
And a doughnut.
AII right.
So what do you want out of life?
I guess I want what everybody wants.
Career, Iove, marriage, chiIdren.
Are you seeing anyone?
This is getting too personaI.
I'm not ready to share this with you.
How about you?
What do you want?
What I reaIIy want
is someone Iike you.
Oh, pIease!
Why not? What are you Iooking for?
Who's your perfect guy?
First of aII, he's too humbIe
to know he's perfect.
That's me!
He's inteIIigent,
supportive, funny....
InteIIigent, supportive, funny.
Me, me, me.
He's romantic and courageous.
Me aIso.
He's got a good body but doesn't
have to Iook in the mirror often.
I have a great body, and sometimes
I go months without Iooking.
He's kind, sensitive and gentIe.
He's not afraid to cry.
This is a man
we're taIking about, right?
He Iikes animaIs, chiIdren,
and he'II change poopy diapers.
Does he have to use the word '' poopy''?
He pIays an instrument,
and he Ioves his mother.
I am reaIIy cIose on this one.
ReaIIy, reaIIy cIose.
It's PhiI Connors!
HeIIo.
Thanks for watching.
What are the chances
of getting out today?
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.
WouIdn't you know it?
Can I buy you a drink?
Jim Beam, ice, water.
For you, miss?
Sweet vermouth on the rocks
with a twist, pIease.
What are the chances
of getting out today?
Van won't start.
Larry's working on it.
WouIdn't you know it?
Can I buy you a drink?
Sweet vermouth, rocks,
with a twist, pIease.
For you, miss?
The same.
That's my favourite drink.
Mine too!
It makes me think of Rome.
The way the sun hits
the buiIdings in the afternoon.
What shouId we drink to?
To the groundhog!
I aIways drink to worId peace.

It makes me think of Rome.

What shouId we drink to?
I'd Iike to say a prayer
and drink to worId peace.
To worId peace.
-This is wonderfuI!
-See? Didn't I teII you?
How do you know so much
about Punxsutawney?
I spent a Iot of time here.
SmaII-town peopIe are
more reaI, down-to-earth.
-That's how I feeI!
-ReaIIy?
-Some white chocoIate?
-Yuck, don't make me sick.
No white chocoIate.
There is something
so famiIiar about this.
Do you ever have deja vu?
Didn't you just ask me that?
PeopIe pIace too much
emphasis on their careers.
I wish we couId aII Iive
in the mountains.
That's where I see myseIf
in five years.
How about you?
I agree. I just Iike
to go with the fIow.
See where it Ieads me.
WeII, it's Ied you here.
It's about a miIIion miIes
from where I started in coIIege.
You weren't in broadcasting
or journaIism?
BeIieve it or not, I studied
What a waste of time!
I mean, for someone eIse
that'd be a totaI waste.
So boId of you to choose that.
It's incredibIe.
You must be a very strong person.
PeopIe pIace too much
emphasis on their careers.
I wish we couId aII
Iive in the mountains.
That's where I see myseIf
in five years.
How about you?
I agree. I Iike to go
with the fIow, see what happens.
WeII, it's gotten you here.
It's a miIIion miIes
from where I started in coIIege.
You weren't in broadcasting
or journaIism or anything Iike that?
BeIieve it or not, I studied
You speak French!
I haven't done this since I was a kid.
Me neither. It's fun!
CIean fun.
I hope one day I can do this
with my own chiIdren.
Where'd you get that?
WeII, I went over
to the snowman shop.
Hey, an assassin!
I'II protect you!
I shaII die for you.
You shaII not take her!
Find cover!
I'm getting some good ones.
That's a boy! Good try.
HeIp me!
What?
I'm just amazed,
and I'm not easiIy amazed.
About what?
How you can start a day with one
kind of expectation...
...and end up
so compIeteIy different.
Do you Iike the way
this day is turning out?
I Iike it very much.
It's a perfect day.
You couIdn't pIan a day Iike this.
WeII, you can.
It just takes an awfuI Iot of work.
Come in.
I want to show you something.
-I don't think I shouId.
-I agree.
That's why I want to show you one thing,
then kick you right out.
It's just IoveIy.
WouId you Iike to sit
and stare at the fake fire?
It's a reaIIy wonderfuI room.
It is now.
I don't think we shouId do this.
I don't either.
On second thought,
I think we shouId.
It's the perfect end
to a perfect day.
WeII, it's a IittIe fast for me.
Me too.
Maybe I shouId go.
Where wouId you go?
Why?
We've got a perfect fire.
I've got some French poetry here.
BaudeIaire....
I wiII read to you.
I've got some ice cream on
the windowsiII. HoId on a minute.
Rocky road.
I Iove rocky road.
Yeah, I thought so.
You have to stay.
No, reaIIy, I'm tired.
We can see each other tomorrow.
No, tonight.
It's got to be tonight.
No, PhiI, reaIIy.
Just stay for a whiIe and
if you Iike it, stay Ionger.
And if you Iike that, stay Ionger.
Let's not spoiI it, okay?
I don't want to spoiI it either.
You know I can't stay with you.
Why not? I Iove you.
You Iove me?
-You don't even know me.
-I know you.
Oh, no. I can't beIieve
I feII for this!
This whoIe day has been
one Iong setup.
No, it hasn't.
And I hate fudge. Yuck!
No white chocoIate, no fudge.
What are you doing?
Are you making some kind of Iist?
Did you caII my friends
and ask them what I Iike?
-Is this what Iove is for you?
-This is reaI. This is Iove.
Stop saying that!
You must be crazy.
I couId never Iove you because
you'II never Iove anyone but yourseIf.
I don't even Iike myseIf.
Give me another chance.
That's for making me
care about you.
I haven't done this
since I was a kid.
It's fun!
And good, cIean fun too.
That's what's missing in the worId.
I can't wait to do this
with my own chiIdren.
I want Iots of kids!
I want to adopt, I want my own kids,
I want to have foster kids.
I got this at Snowman City.
Hey! Some kid just
threw a snowbaII at us.
Come here! Let's have some fun!
I wish these were my own kids.
Are any of you up for adoption?
Here's a humdinger over here!
Wasn't that great?
Stop it!
PhiI! Over here!
Where have you been?
You're missing the fun.
PhiI, you Iook terribIe.
What happened? Rough night?
Okay, campers.
Rise and shine.
Don't forget your booties,
because it's coId out there.
It's coId out there every day.
This country's largest lake,
Chapala, is located near Guadalajara.
What is Mexico?
What is Mexico?
-Correct.
-Lakes and Rivers, 400.
Seneca is the largest
of these lakes.
What are the Finger Lakes?
-What are the Finger Lakes?
-Correct.
-This lake in Bolivia--
-What is Titicaca?
-What is Titicaca?
-Correct.
For 1 ,000.
-Milky-coloured--
-The Rhone.
... when entering Lake Geneva...
... this river is
clear blue upon exiting.
-Jim?
-The Rhone.
Good for $1, 000.
You're $500 off the lead right now.
This is pitifuI.
A thousand peopIe...
...freezing their butts off,
waiting to worship a rat.
What a hype.
They used to puII the hog out,
and they used to eat it.
You're hypocrites! AII of you!
You got a probIem, Larry?
Untie your tongue.
Come here and taIk.
Am I upsetting you...
...princess?
You want a prediction
about the weather?
You're asking the wrong PhiI.
I'II give you a winter prediction.
It's going to be coId.
It's going to be gray.
And it's going to Iast you
for the rest of your Iife.
Once again the eyes of the nation
have turned here...
...to this tiny viIIage
in Western PennsyIvania.
There is no way that this winter...
...is ever going to end...
...as Iong as this groundhog
keeps seeing his shadow.
I don't see any other way out.
He's got to be stopped.
And I have to stop it.
ReaI good, PhiI.
ReaI good.
He's out of his gourd.
I'm worried. There's something
reaIIy wrong with PhiI.
There's a Iot of things
wrong with PhiI.
Hi, PhiI.
I've come to the end of me.
There's no way out now.
Just remember, we had
a beautifuI day together once.
AII right, IittIe feIIow.
Good job. He just smiIed at me!
Did you see that?
I beIieve he did.
Okay, IittIe feIIow.
There you go.
Hi, there. Something I can
do you for?
Hey! What are you doing?
Get the word out.
Somebody kidnapped PhiI!
We are going after him!
Why wouId anybody steaI a groundhog?
I couId think of reasons.
Pervert.
He must have just snapped!
This ought to be good.
What is he doing?
What can he be thinking?
Not bad for a quadruped.
Check your mirrors. Side of your eye.
Side of your eye.
That's it.
Hey, they're chasing us!
Come on, make it fun.
Don't drive angry.
Don't drive angry.
There's no way out
except the way we came in!
We got him now!
What is he doing?
I don't know.
If you got to shoot,
don't hit the groundhog.
Mustn't keep them waiting.
It's showtime.
On me in three...
...two...
...one.
PhiI!
He might be okay.
WeII, no. ProbabIy not now.
Nuts.
Did you sIeep weII, Mr. Connors?
WouId you Iike...
...some toast?
Oh, my God!
That's him.
He was a reaIIy, reaIIy great guy.
I reaIIy, reaIIy Iiked him...
...a Iot.
I'm sorry?
What was that again?
-I'm a god.
-You're God?
I'm a god. I'm not the god,
I don't think.
Because you survived a car wreck?
You foIks ready to order?
I didn't just survive a wreck.
I wasn't just bIown up.
I have been stabbed,
shot, poisoned...
...frozen, hung, eIectrocuted
and burned.
Oh, reaIIy.
Every morning I wake up without a
scratch, not a dent in the fender.
I am an immortaI.
SpeciaI today is bIueberry waffIes.
Why are you teIIing me this?
Because I want you to beIieve in me.
You are not a god.
Take my word. It's 1 2 years
of CathoIic schooI taIking.
I can come back if you're not ready.
How do you know I'm not a god?
PIease.
-How do you know?
-It's not possibIe.
I'II come back.
Doris.
This is Doris.
Her brother-in-Iaw owns this diner.
She's worked here since she was 1 7.
She wants to see Paris...
...before she dies.
Boy, wouId I!
-What are you doing?
-Debbie and her fiance.
Do I know you?
They're supposed to get married.
She's having second thoughts.
What?
LoveIy ring.
BiII's been a waiter three years,
since he Ieft Penn State to work.
He Iikes the town,
paints toy soIdiers, and he's gay.
I am.
Gus hates it here,
wishes he'd stayed in the Navy.
I couId've retired
on haIf pay after 20 years.
Excuse me. Is this a trick?
Maybe the reaI God uses tricks.
Maybe he's not omnipotent...
...he just knows everything.
-Who's that?
-Tom.
He worked in the coaI mine
tiII it cIosed.
-And her?
-AIice.
Came from IreIand when she
was a baby. Lived in Erie.
He's right.
-And her?
-Nancy.
Works in a shop, makes noises Iike
a chipmunk when she gets excited.
-It's true.
-How do you know this?
I toId you, I know everything.
In five seconds, a waiter
wiII drop a tray.
-Five, four, three, two, one.
-This is nuts.
-Okay?
-Okay, that's enough.
What about me?
Do you know me too?
I know aII about you. You hope
for more than ChanneI 9 Pittsburgh.
WeII, everyone knows that.
You Iike boats but not the ocean.
You go to a Iake in the summer
with your famiIy.
There's a dock and a boathouse
with boards missing from the roof...
...and a pIace you used to
crawI underneath to be aIone.
You're a sucker for
French poetry and rhinestones.
You're very generous.
You're kind to strangers
and chiIdren.
When you stand in the snow
you Iook Iike an angeI.
How are you doing this?
I toId you. I wake up every day.
Right here.
Right in Punxsutawney.
And it's aIways February 2nd.
And there's nothing
I can do about it.
If you stiII can't beIieve me, Iisten:
In 1 0 seconds...
...Larry is going to come
and take you away from me.
But you can't Iet him.
PIease beIieve me.
You've got to beIieve me.
You guys ready? We better go,
to stay ahead of the weather.
What's that?
''--to stay ahead of the weather.''
Maybe it reaIIy is happening.
How eIse couId you know so much?
There is no way.
I'm not that smart.
Maybe I shouId
spend the day with you...
...as an objective witness,
just to see what happens.
This sounds Iike a science project.
Concentrate.
You got to want it.
You got to want it, Rita.
Come on. It's more
in the wrist than the fingers.
Be the hat. Come on, go.
-It'd take me a year to get good.
-Six months.
Four to five hours a day,
and you'd be an expert.
-Is this what you do with eternity?
-Now you know.
That's not the worst part.
What's the worst part?
The worst part is that...
...tomorrow you'II have
forgotten aII about this...
...and you'II treat me
Iike a jerk again.
I am a jerk.
No, you're not.
It doesn't make any difference.
I've kiIIed myseIf so many times...
...I don't even exist anymore.
Sometimes I wish I had
a thousand Iifetimes.
I don't know.
Maybe it's not a curse.
It just depends
on how you Iook at it.
Gosh, you're an upbeat Iady!
I want you to know it's been
a reaIIy nice day for me.
Me too.
And maybe...
...if it's not too boring,
we can do it again sometime.
I hope so.
You're stiII here?
I thought you were supposed
to disappear. Or I was.
Not untiI 6.
You rat!
I never said midnight.
You knew I was waiting for midnight.
Are you going to Ieave?
Good.
I'm sorry.
It's aII right.
You can faII asIeep.
I promise I won't touch you.
Much.
It's aII right. I'm not tired.
What were you saying?
I think the Iast thing
that you heard was...
...onIy God couId make a tree.
ReaIIy?
What I wanted to say was...
...I think you are the kindest...
...sweetest, prettiest person...
...I've ever met in my Iife.
I've never seen anyone...
...that's nicer to peopIe
than you are.
And the first time I saw you...
...something happened to me.
I never toId you...
...but I knew I wanted
to hoId you...
...as hard as I couId.
I don't deserve someone Iike you.
But if I ever couId...
...I swear I wouId Iove you...
...for the rest of my Iife.
Did you say something?
Good night, Rita.
Good night, PhiI.
Campers, rise and shine!
Don't forget your booties.
-It's cold out there!
-It's cold every day.
-Is this Miami Beach?
-Not hardly!
Who wants coffee?
Get it whiIe it's hot.
Thanks, PhiI.
Larry?
Skim miIk, two sugar.
Thanks, PhiI.
Pastry?
We're setting up.
Pastry, Larry?
Take your pick.
Thanks. Raspberry. Great.
I taIked with Buster Green,
the head groundhog honcho.
He said if we set up here
we'II get a better shot.
-What do you think?
-Sounds good.
Larry?
Yeah. Let's go for it.
Good work, PhiI.
Maybe we'II get Iucky.
Let me give you a hand.
No, no. You got your coffee.
I'II get it.
We never taIk.
Do you have kids?
I'd Iike a piano Iesson.
I'm with a student. But if you
want to come back tomorrow--
I kind of want to get started.
I can give you $1 ,000.
Come on in.
Morning!
Off to see the groundhog?
Buon giorno, signore!
Think it'II be an earIy spring?
''Winter, sIumbering in the open air
Wears on his smiIing face...
...a dream of spring''
Ciao!
Ciao!
How does she Iook?
Great.
Thank you.
Did you know he couId ice scuIpt?
Not bad. You say
this is your first Iesson?
Yes, but my father
was a piano mover, so....
-PhiI Connors, I thought it was you.
-Ned Ryerson.
I have missed you so much.
I don't know where you're headed,
but can you caII in sick?
I got to get going.
It's good to see you, PhiI.
HeIIo, father.
Let's get you somepIace warm.
Remember me?
You brought the oId man in?
How is he?
He just passed away.
-What did he die of?
-He was just oId.
It was just his time.
-I want to see his chart. Excuse me.
-Sir!
You can't come in here.
Sir, this is a restricted area.
Where's the chart?
Sometimes peopIe just die.
Not today.
Gets hard down there at the bottom.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Come on, dad.
Come on, pop.
Come on. Come on, breathe.
Breathe, pop! Breathe, pop!
When Chekhov saw the Iong winter...
...he saw a winter bIeak
and dark and bereft of hope.
Yet we know winter is just
another step in the cycIe of Iife.
But standing here among
the peopIe of Punxsutawney...
...and basking in the warmth
of their hearths and hearts...
...I couIdn't imagine a better fate...
...than a Iong and Iustrous winter.
From Punxsutawney, it's PhiI Connors.
So Iong.
Nice speech. Very nice.
Thank you.
-How was that for you two?
-My man, you touched me.
-Thanks, Larry.
-Thank you.
I got to go.
That was surprising.
I didn't know you were so versatiIe.
I surprise myseIf sometimes.
WouId you Iike a cup of coffee?
I'd Iove to. Can I have a rain check?
I've got some errands.
Errands? What errands?
I thought we were going back.
What do you say?
What do you say?
You IittIe brat.
You have never thanked me!
I'II see you tomorrow...
...maybe.
You totaIed it.
-It's onIy a fIat tire.
-What are we going to do?
-It's an earthquake!
-It's not an earthquake.
What is it?
Thank you, young man.
It's nothing.
I had the tire and the jack.
Just be comfortabIe.
It'II be a minute.
Who is that?
He must be from the motor cIub.
He's having a heart attack!
Do something!
CaII 41 1 , an ambuIance, a Iawyer,
doctor, anything!
I think that did it.
If you're going to eat steak,
get sharper teeth.
-Enjoy your meaI.
-Thank you.
Who was that?
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-Are you sure?
Eat, eat!
People don't understand...
...what's invoIved.
This is an art form.
I think most peopIe just think...
...that I hoId a camera
and point it at stuff.
There's a Iot more to it than that.
WouId you be interested in seeing
the inside of a van?
You know, I reaIIy have to
get back to the party.
Great idea.
I'II go with you.
Let me just drop a tip here.
Hi! How are you?
Rita, this is Nancy.
We were going to the party.
You going?
Sounds Iike fun.
Maybe we shouId caII PhiI.
I think he's aIready in there.
Isn't he good?
He's great!
He's my student.
I'm so proud.
Thank you.
HeIIo, weIcome to our party.
I didn't know you couId
pIay Iike that.
I'm versatiIe.
It's that nice young man
from the motor cIub.
Thank you again.
It's nothing, Iadies.
He's the fastest jack
in Jefferson County.
What was that aII about?
Don't know. They've been
hitting on me aII night.
There you are!
I never thanked you properIy
for what you did.
He wouId've choked for sure.
He may have. He was trying
to swaIIow a whoIe cow.
I owe you one, buddy.
Hang on to him, dear.
He's a reaI find.
What did you do today?
Same oId, same oId.
Excuse me, Mr. Connors.
Fred, how was the wedding?
Thank you for making
Debbie go through with it.
AII I did was fan her fIame
of passion for you.
You are the best.
No, you are.
Rita, this is
Debbie and Fred KIeiser.
-Here you go, kids. CongratuIations.
-What is this?
No way!
WrestIeMania!
No way!
How'd you know?
We'II be in Pittsburgh anyway!
Thank you. You're a reaI paI.
Oh, this is the best.
I don't understand.
I guess not.
How does everyone know you?
You come once a year.
You're the most popuIar
person in town.
Excuse me, Dr. Connors?
I want to thank you
for fixing FeIix's back.
He can heIp around the house again.
WeII, I'm sorry
to hear that, FeIix.
Dr. Connors?
It's kind of an honorary titIe.
What is going on?
I reaIIy don't know.
There is something
going on with you.
You want the Iong or short version?
Let's start with the short
and go from there.
Okay, foIks, attention.
Time for the bacheIor auction.
You know the ruIes.
AII the eIigibIe bacheIors
come in front.
And you Iadies...
...you bid on them!
Do whatever you want with them...
...no questions asked!
I don't want to know about it,
as Iong as it's IegaI.
Get out your pocketbooks,
and remember it's aII for charity.
What are you doing down here?
Go on, get up there.
I got 1 0 bucks
that says you're mine.
Buster, I got your first victim.
PhiI Connors, come on up here!
AII right! Now, what am I bid

CongratuIations!
Okay, bacheIors, who's next?
AII right! Now, what am I

Do I hear a buck and a haIf?
Anybody?
I bid a twopence!
SoId to the Iady for 25 cents.
I got him!
PhiI Connors,
I thought that was you.
This is Ned Ryerson,
my new insurance agent.
I'II say.
I haven't seen him for 20 years.
He comes up and buys whoIe Iife,
term, fire, auto, dentaI, heaIth...
...with the optionaI death
and dismemberment pIan.
This is the best day of my Iife.
-Mine too.
-Mine too.
Where are we going?
Let's not spoiI it.
Let's not--
I got that.
Why can't I Iook?
Because you bother me a Iot.
I'm getting coId.
How Iong do I have to sit here?
I'm giving you your money's worth.
You paid top doIIar for me.
WeII, I think you were a bargain.
Sweet of you to say.
You're right.
Is it finished yet?
I stiII have to put
cherry syrup on the top...
...then we can eat it.
Come on, PhiI.
I'm freezing!
One second, one second.
Let me turn it in the Iight.
It's amazing.
It's beautifuI.
How did you do that?
I know your face so weII,
I couId've done it with my eyes cIosed.
It's IoveIy.
I don't know what to say.
I do.
No matter what happens tomorrow...
...or for the rest of my Iife...
...I'm happy now...
...because I Iove you.
I think I'm happy too.
Please. Not again.
-That's a great song.
-It's not.
Don't listen to this man--
It's too earIy.
Something is different.
Good or bad?
Anything different is good.
But this couId be reaI good.
Why are you here?
I bought you.
I own you.
But why are you stiII here?
You said, ''Stay,''
so I stayed.
I said, ''Stay,''
so you stayed.
I can't even make a coIIie stay.
I got to check something.
Stay.
Stay.
They're gone!
They're aII gone.
-Do you know what today is?
-No, what?
Today is tomorrow.
It happened.
-You're here.
-I'm here.
Why weren't you Iike this Iast night?
You just feII asIeep.
It was the end of a very Iong day.
Is there anything I can do
for you today?
I'm sure I can think of something.
It's so beautifuI!
Let's Iive here.
We'II rent to start.

He is coming.
Cover your butt.
Cover the what?
Vitruvius.
Lord Business.
You've hidden the Kragle well, old man.
Robots, destroy him!
Yes, Lord Business.
Your robots are no match
for a MasterBuilder.
For I see everything!
Unh! My eyes! Ow!
The Kragle.
The most powerful super weapon...
...is mine.
Oh, the Kragle!
Now my evil power will be unlimited!
Can you feel me?
I can feel you.
Whoo! Nothing's gonna stop me now.
Wait. There was a prophecy.
Oh, now there's a prophecy.
About the Piece of Resistance.
Oh, yes! The supposed
missing Piece of Resistance...
...that can somehow magically
disarm the Kragle.
Give me a break!
One day, a talented lass or fellow
A Special One with face of yellow
Will make the Piece of Resistance found
From its hiding refuge underground
And with a noble army at the helm
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm
And be the greatest
Most interesting
Most important person of all times
All of this is true
Because it rhymes
Oh, wow.
That was a great, inspiring legend...
...that you made up.
A "Special One"?
What a bunch of hippie-dippie baloney.
Good morning, apartment!
Good morning, doorway!
Good morning, wall.
Good morning, ceiling.
Good morning, floor!
Ready to start the day!
Ah, here it is!
"Instructions to fit in...
...have everybody like you...
...and always be happy!
Step one:
Breathe. "
Okay, got that one down.
"Step two: Greet the day,
smile and say... "
Good morning, city!
Good morning, city!
Good morning, city!
Good morning, city!
Top of the morning to you there, city!
Good morning, city! How you doing?
Good morning, city!
"Step three: Exercise. "
Jumping jacks. Hit them!
One!
Two!
Three!
I am so pumped up!
"Step four: Shower. "
And always be sure to keep
the soap out of your...! Aah!
Shave your face.
Brush your teeth.
Comb your hair. Hmm.
"Wear clothes. "
Oop! I almost forgot that one!
No. No. Uh-uh. No.
Not that. Wrong.
And that's it. Check.
Step nine:
Eat a complete breakfast...
...with all the special people in your life.
Hey, Plantie, what do you
wanna do this morning?
Watch TV? Me too!
Hi, I'm President Business...
...president of the Octan Corporation
and the world.
Let's take extra care to follow
the instructions, or you'll be put to sleep.
And don't forget Taco Tuesday's
coming next week!
That's the day every rule-following citizen
gets a free taco and my love!
Have a great day, everybody!
You have a great day too,
President Business.
Man, he's such a cool guy.
I always wanna hear more of what...
Wait, did he say "put to sleep"?
Tonight on Where Are My Pants?
Honey, where are my pants?
What was I just thinking? I don't care.
"Step 11: Greet your neighbors. "
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, pal.
Whoa! Hey, Surfer Dave.
Hey, brah.
- Oh, good morning, Sherrie.
- Hey, fella.
- Oh, hey, Jasmine, Dexter.
Meow. Meow.
- Angie, Loki, Bad Leroy.
Meow. Meow. Meow.
- Fluffy, Fluffy Junior, Fluffy Senior.
Meow. Meow. Meow.
- Jeff.
Meow.
Step 12:
Obey all traffic signs and regulations.
Step 13: Enjoy popular music.
Top of the charts again...
...it's "Everything Is Awesome. "
- Oh, my gosh, I love this song!
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team
Everything is awesome
When we're living our
Dream
Always use a turn signal.
Park between the lines. Yes!
Drop off dry-cleaning before noon.
Read the headlines.
Don't forget to smile.
Always root for the local sports team.
Go, Sports Team!
Always return a compliment.
- Hey, you look nice.
So do you!
Drink overpriced coffee.
Here you go. That's $37.
Awesome!
Everything is awesome
Did you see
Where Are My Pants? last night?
"Honey, where's my pants?"
Classic episode.
Everything is awesome
Instructions coming in from Central.
Okay, it says here to take
everything weird and blow it up.
All right, Cylinderheads...
...let's make it look
like it does in the instructions!
Hey, buddy!
I need a 1-by-2 key hole.
No problem, Michael.
We need a 2-by-2 macaroni.
2- by-2 macaroni flying in. Here's one.
Look out, guys, I got a 1-by-1
with an indented stud on one side.
- Cheese slopes. Come on, everybody.
Roger that, Roger.
Look alive, coming at you.
Can I get a couple LURPs over here?
Thanks, Gail.
Guys, watch me drill this down.
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team
Everything is awesome
When we're living our dream
Have you heard the news?
Everyone's talkin'
Life is good
Because everything's awesome
Man, I feel so good right now!
I could sing this song for hours!
Everything is awesome
When we're living our dream
When you're part of a team!
Yeah!
I'm going to the sports bar
after work tonight.
Who wants to eat some delicious
chicken wings and get crazy?
Chicken wings? I love chicken wings!
Hey, who wants to share a croissant
with this guy?
Croissants? I love croissants.
Oh, yeah! I sure do love giant sausages.
Giant sausages? No way!
You know what I love to do?
Is share a meal
with the special people in my life.
Fred, Barry, Gail, me and you?
Ah! No, wait, guys!
Wait up! Okay, I'll meet you there.
Oh. Where did it go?
Oh, there you are.
I think I heard a whoosh.
Hey, pal, I hate to tell you this...
...but, uh, I don't think
you're supposed to be here.
Yeah, the rules specifically state...
...work site closes at 6,
it's a hard-hat area only.
That's not official safety orange.
"If you see anything weird,
report it immediately. "
Well, I guess I'm gonna...
...have to report youuu...
...uuu...
...uuu...
...uuu...
...uuu...
...uuu...
...uuu...
...uuu...
...uuu...
Where are you going? Miss!
I didn't mean to scare you! I'm sor...
Ow. Ow!
Hey! Heh. That's not so bad.
Yeow! Ooh! Aah! Aah! Ooh!
Ow.
Ow.
Hey.
What is that?
Come here.
What do I do?
I don't have my instructions.
Touch the Piece.
Touch the Piece. Touch the Piece.
I feel like maybe I should touch that.
It's so...
...interesting.
Touch the Piece.
It's so interesting.
Touch the Piece.
Touch the Piece.
- Touch the Piece.
- Uh...
Touch the...
A Special One with face of yellow
Will make the Piece of Resistance found
From its hiding refuge underground
What's going on down here?
This MasterBuilder will thwart
The Kragle and save the realm
Come on, Emmet!
The Special has arisen.
It's your turn to be the hero.
Wake up.
Ugh.
Come on, wake up!
Where are the MasterBuilders?
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance? Eh?
- Where are the others hiding?
Good morning, apartment?
- Wake up!
- Aah!
How did you find
the Piece of Resistance?
The piece of what?
The Piece of Resistance.
L... I don't... Where am I? What's happening?
"What's happening?"
Playing dumb, MasterBuilder.
No. L... "MasterBuilder"?
- Oh. So you've never heard of the prophecy?
- No.
Or The Special?
No, no!
You're a liar! We'll kill you!
Look, um,
I watch a lot of cop shows on TV.
Isn't there supposed to also be...?
Isn't there supposed to be a good cop?
Oh, yes. But we're not done yet.
Hi, buddy! I'm your friendly
neighborhood police officer!
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Yeah. Yeah, actually.
Too bad.
Security cameras picked up this.
Unh! You were found at the construction site
convulsing with a strange piece.
That's disgusting!
Then why is it permanently stuck
to your back?
Get it off me! Get it off me! Aah!
It won't come off! It's chasing me!
Look, it's not my fault!
I have no idea how this thing
got on my back!
Of course, buddy. I believe you.
Great. Aah!
I "believe" you too.
You see the quotations
I'm making with my claw hands?
It means I don't believe you!
Why else would you show up
with that thing on your back...
...just three days before
President Business...
...is going to use the Kragle
to end the world?
President Business is gonna end the world?
But he's such a good guy.
And Octan, they make good stuff.
Music, dairy products, coffee, TVshows...
...surveillance systems,
all history books, voting machines.
Wait a minute.
Come on, you can't be this stupid.
This is a misunderstanding.
I'm just a regular, normal, ordinary guy.
I'm late to meet my best friends
in the whole world.
They're probably missing me right now.
They're probably out looking around.
"Hey, where's Emmet?
Hey, where's my best friend Emmet?"
Hey, you know what?
Ask all my friends. They'll tell you.
Oh, we asked them, all right.
Boom!
That guy's not a criminal mastermind.
See?
Yeah. You know, he's kind of
an average, normal kind of guy.
Thank you.
But, you know, he's not, like...
...normal like us. No.
He's not that special.
Wait, I'm so confused.
Who are we talking about?
Wait, does he work with us?
Gail doesn't remember me?
Look at Randy here.
He likes sausage. That's something.
Gail is perky. That's something.
And Harry...
...well...
- When you say Harry, I go:
When you say the other guy, I go:
Harry's the best!
- Harry's got personality.
He's weird! He's weird!
I know that guy but I know, like,
zippy-zap about him.
We just talked earlier.
I mean, all he does is say yes...
...to everything everybody else is doing.
You know, he's just sort of a "Hmm!"
Little bit of a blank slate, I guess.
That'll be $42, please.
We all have something that makes us
something and Emmet is...
...nothing.
There you go.
- I told you I was a nobody.
Oh.
It's the perfect cover.
Cover? Cover for what?
I can't break him.
Take him to the melting chamber.
What? Aah!
You're gonna melt me? Am I gonna die?
You'll live. You'll be fine.
President Business.
I have him right here, sir.
Yes, we've told him he'll live
so he doesn't try to escape, but, um...
...we're lying to him.
Wait, what did he just say?
Hold still.
Wait! There's obviously been a mix-up here.
You've got the wrong...
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
That is gonna start hurting...
...pretty soon.
Ow, ow, ow!
No, no, no!
Whoa. Who are you?
It's you?
Come with me if you wanna not die.
Hi, everybody! How's the melting goi...?
Hey, hey, hey!
Red alert, red alert.
I need everyone, repeat:
Everyone,
to go after The Special.
The tunnel's that way.
Oh, boy!
Oh, sir, you're brilliant.
- We'll build a motorcycle out of the alleyway.
- Ow. Oh.
So, uh, didn't catch your name...
...or anything about what you're, uh, up to.
Or what we're doing here.
It's brilliant, sir, that you pretended
to be a useless nobody...
...but you can drop the act with me.
It's cool.
Oh, the act.
Whoa.
Whoa!
Jump on. Let's go!
Hey, uh, I...
Hang on, sir.
All units...
...cut him off on Elm, now!
Or whenever you can.
10-4, Bad Cop.
- Watch out!
- Hold on.
We need to meet up with Vitruvius...
...and tell him the Piece has been found.
Uh-huh.
They're up on the monorail.
Release the copper choppers.
Oh, no!
Will you please tell me what is happening?
I'm rescuing you, sir.
You're the one the prophecy spoke of.
You're The Special.
Me?
You found the Piece of Resistance.
And the prophecy states...
...that you are the most important,
most talented...
...most interesting...
...and most extraordinary person
in the universe.
That's you. Right?
Uh, yes. That's me.
Great. You drive.
What?
I wanna go home!
This is not what I meant!
Oh, no.
Look out, Special!
Uh, sorry. Never driven a motorcycle. Sorry!
- Wow, he's amazing.
- Aah!
That was incredible!
You're even better
than the prophecy said you'd be.
Oh. Really?
I'm, uh... I'm Wyldstyle.
- Oh, I'm sorry, what was it?
- Wyldstyle.
- "Wyldstyle"?
Yep.
- What are you, a DJ?
No.
- Oh, that's your name? "Wyldstyle"?
- Yeah.
Like on your birth certificate,
it says "Wyldstyle. "
Let's not talk about my name!
Don't let The Special get away.
Sir, we've blocked the freeway.
Hang on, sir!
What are you doing?
Let's fly!
Whoa!
Head for the secret tunnel.
Uh, these are the city limits.
Let's just head for the tunnel.
You want me to drive
into that weird swirly hole?
Are you insane?
Don't brake! Go! Don't stop! Go! Now!
I can't do this!
That is against the instructions!
Wait, what's your favorite restaurant?
Any chain restaurant.
Favorite TV show?
Where Are My Pants?
Favorite song?
Everything Is Awesome
Oh, no!
Darn, darn, darn, darny-darn!
Wait. Where are we?
This is so weir...! Ow!
You're not The Special! You lied to me!
It really kind of depends on...
You're not even a MasterBuilder, are you?
Uh, I mean, I know what a MasterBuilder is.
Why don't you tell me what it is?
That way I could see if you're right.
You've ruined the prophecy.
Look, I'm sorry, okay? You just...
You made being special sound so good.
And to think I was going to follow you
to the end of the universe.
You were?
Here's the thing.
How do we know for sure
that I'm not The Special?
- We just don't know it yet.
- Quiet.
Y'all want a giant turkey leg?
Do you have any idea
what that does to your colon?
- Oh, my G-O-S-H.
Just put the hat on.
Oh...
...and this. And this. And this.
- And this.
- Aah!
And, by the way, I have a boyfriend.
Uh, I'm not sure exactly
why you'd bring that up.
It's super serious.
You do not want to mess with him.
Okay.
So don't get any ideas.
I never have any ideas.
Wait!
Stick them up.
Hands where I can see them.
Hey, uh, listen. You think
you can explain why I'm dressed like this...
...and what those big words
in the sky were all about?
And, like, where we are in time.
Your home, Bricksburg,
is one of many realms in the universe.
There's also this one...
...Pirate's Cove, Knight's Club,
Viking's Landing, Clown Town...
...a bunch of others
we don't need to mention.
Mm-hm.
Lord Business,
or as you think you know him...
...President Business...
...stole the Kragle,
the most powerful object in the universe.
Blah, blah, blah.
Proper name. Place name. Backstory stuff.
...Piece of Resistance is The Special.
Mm-hm.
I'm so pretty. I like you.
But I'm angry with you for some reason.
...tower at the end of the universe...
Mm-hm.
...put the Piece of Resistance
onto the Kragle...
...and disarm it forever.
Great.
I think I got it...
...butjust in case...
...tell me the whole thing again.
I wasn't listening.
Okay. All the people
of the universe were once free to travel...
...and mingle and build
whatever they wanted.
But President Business
was confused by all the chaos.
So he erected walls between the worlds...
...and became obsessed
with order and perfection.
And he stole the mysterious...
...secret super weapon called...
The Kragle!
- And he hired Bad Cop...
...to hunt down all the MasterBuilders,
who were always changing everything.
And those of us who remained...
...well, we went into hiding.
Built the tunnels to survive.
And we search for the Piece of Resistance.
The only thing that can stop the Kragle.
Kragle. I know that.
It might have been that cop.
He said something about the Kragle.
President Business
was going to use the Kragle...
...to end the world in three days.
I can't make any sense of it.
Taco Tuesday.
I knew that was suspicious.
There's no time to lose.
We must find Vitruvius and get to
the Office Tower before it's too late.
Okay.
Heh. How scary can someone's office be?
President Business,
we're trying to locate the fugitive...
...but his face is so generic it matches
every other face in our database.
Diabolical.
Okay, have Bad Cop meet me in my office...
...in 23 seconds. Ciao.
- Will do, sir.
Coffee sales are through the roof, sir.
Glad to hear it.
Let's rebuild that roof to be even higher!
- The roof team is on it.
- Ha, ha.
Sir, can you approve this poster
for Taco Tuesday?
Perfect. Whoo!
- I love everyone in this room.
We love you, sir!
Greatjob on the radio station.
Thank you, sir.
We love listening to this song
over and over again.
Keep it up, guys.
Honey, where are my...
...pants?
Ha-ha-ha!
Cut! Ha, ha!
Hilarious. That never gets old.
It does not.
Bad Cop is waiting for you
in your office.
Wonderful. Fantastic.
Would you cancel my 2:00?
This next meeting could run a little bit...
...deadly.
Activate helmet.
Light sequence.
Flame test.
- Engage dramatic entrance.
Aah!
Bad Cop.
Lord Business.
I know The Special got away, but...
Don't be so serious.
Where's the other guy?
- Hey, friend.
Hey, buddy!
- I missed you.
- Aw, did you really?
Have I ever shown you my relic collection?
Nope. I don't think you have.
Nobody knows where this stuff comes from.
This one...
...is the Cloak of Ban Da'Id.
I hear it's super painful to take off.
- You wanna try it on?
- Well, um...
No, but thank you.
We've done some great work
over the years together, Bad Cop...
...capturing all those MasterBuilders...
...and torturing them and whatnot.
Thank you, sir.
Although...
...you did let the Piece of Resistance go.
The one thing that can ruin my plans.
The one thing that I asked you to take care of.
That's super frustrating.
It makes me just wanna pick up whoever...
...is standing closest to me...
...and throw them through this window...
...and out into the infinite abyss
of nothingness!
I wanna do it so bad.
I know you do, sir. Please don't.
And it's notjust you, Bad Cop,
that keeps messing up my plans.
People everywhere
are always messing with my stuff.
But I have a way to fix that.
A way to keep things exactly
the way they are supposed to be.
Permanently.
Behold...
...the most powerful weapon...
...of all the relics:
The Kragle!
As you can see, they're
loading the Kragle in a big machine upstairs.
I call it...
...the Tentacle Arm Kragle Outside Sprayer.
Or TAKOS.
The "S" is silent.
So on Taco Tuesday...
...it's going to spray the Kragle
over everyone and everything...
...with a bunch of super-scary nozzles
like this one!
- I'll show you how it works.
- Sir, I don't know if this is necessary.
Oh, don't worry. I won't test it on you.
I'll do it on your parents!
What?
- Hi, son.
- Hi!
How's it going in the big city?
Mommy. Daddy.
What are you doing here?
Okay, Pa. I just want you to act naturally.
- Like you're going about your day.
- Gotcha.
Yeah. Keep your hand up like that.
Ma, scoot...
...two steps in to the right.
- Pa, whenever I talk to Ma...
- Uh-huh?
...you start to move.
- Sorry, sir.
Get back to where you were!
- Here?
Perfect.
That's great. You can't do anything better.
No reason why you should move.
Right.
Now, Ma...
...hand on his shoulder. And you...
Pa, you just moved...
...and you've just wrecked it!
- Uh-huh.
You wrecked it!
Bad Cop, you see what I'm talking about?
All I'm asking for is total perfection.
Send in a Micro-manager!
Commencing micro-management.
Hold still, you guys.
And then...
...I just spray them...
...with the TAKOS.
Oh, Pa, hold me.
Oh, darling, I can't move me legs.
- Does that upset you, Bad Cop?
- Um...
Surely you feel bad for your parents,
and you wanna help them, don't you?
We're okay, son. Just a little stuck, is all.
Go ahead...
...finish the job.
Of course, sir.
No, I don't want to.
- You have to.
- I don't want to.
- Would you please be quiet?
- I can't.
- You must. Shut it!
- But they...
- It's not nice.
- It's yourjob, man.
I can't do it.
- They're innocent.
- Just as I thought.
Your Good Cop side's
making you soft, Bad Cop.
Robots!
Bring me the fleece-crested
Scepter of Q-Teep...
...and the P-Lish Remover of Na-ll.
You've already let The Special
get away once.
Sir.
I'm just gonna make sure
it doesn't happen again.
No more Mr. Nice Guy!
Oh, son!
On Taco Tuesday,
I'm going to Kragleize the entire universe...
...so that everyone
will stop messing with my stuff!
Are you gonna be with me...
...or are you gonna be stuck...
...having a tea party
with your mom and dad?
Son?
Sorry, Dad.
I have ajob to do.
All you have to do is blend in
and act like you belong here.
Ah, perfect.
Well, hi there, I'm a cowboy!
Bang, bang, bang-bang-bang-bang!
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Bullet, bullet, gun.
Zap, zap, zap, pow. Zap, pow.
What are they looking at?
I made a mistake.
You should just be still. Act like a stool.
- Wait!
- Howdy, guys!
- Quiet. Nope, stools don't talk.
- Come sit on me.
Okay, shh.
Let me show you how it's done.
What a lady!
Okay, let me just find the wizard...
...and get this over with.
- Ooh!
- There he is.
- Vitruvius.
- Who?
I've never heard of that man,
whom I am not.
- Who are you?
- It's me.
I am a blind man and cannot see.
- It's Wyldstyle.
- Oof.
Are you a DJ?
- What? Why does everybody...?
- Oh, wait, wait.
Are you the student I used to have...
...who was so insecure
she kept changing her name?
No, no, no.
- First Darkstorm, then Geminizzle.
- No. Never.
Then Neversmile, then Freakface,
then Snazzypants.
Okay. All right, yes.
Meet me upstairs in 10 seconds.
Oh, man.
You have a very weirdly...
...decorated place.
- Thank you.
Vitruvius, we have found
the Piece of Resistance.
- Is it true?
Yes, but...
Wyldstyle. The prophecy states that...
...you are The Special.
The embodiment of good,
foiler of evil.
The most talented, most brilliant...
...most important person in the universe.
That would be great...
...but Emmet is the one...
...who found the Piece.
Oh, okay. Emmet!
The prophecy states that...
...you are The Special.
- The most talented...
- I'm not sure he's The Special.
Because he's not even
a MasterBuilder. Watch.
Emmet, just given what's around you...
...build something simple.
- Okay.
Like an awesome race car.
- Great.
Go.
- Do you have the instructions?
No. You must create the instructions
in your mind, my liege.
Ah. Okay. Race car.
Um...
Well, there's a lot of really cool stuff here.
Don't see a wheel...
...or...
...three more wheels.
See? He can't do it.
He will never be a MasterBuilder.
Of course not.
Not if you keep telling him he can't.
He needs to see that he can.
What are you doing?
We are entering your mind...
- What?
...to prove that you have
the unlocked potential...
...to be a MasterBuilder.
Ujjayi breath.
Whoa, are we inside my brain right now?
- It's big. I must be smart.
Mm-hm.
I'm not hearing a lot of activity here.
I don't think he's ever had
an original thought. In his life.
Ha, ha. That's not true.
For instance, one time I wanted to have...
...a bunch of my friends over to watch TV...
Not unlike this TV
thatjust showed up magically.
And not everybody
can fit on my one couch...
...and I thought to myself:
"What if there was such a thing
as a bunk bed...
...but as a couch?"
Introducing the double-decker couch.
So everyone could watch TV together
and be buddies!
That is literally the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.
Please, Wyldstyle, let me handle this.
That idea is just the worst.
There must be something around here...
...that proves his potential.
If The Man Upstairs
chose him to be The Special...
...there must be a reason.
Who's The Man Upstairs?
- See?
He doesn't even know about
The Man Upstairs.
Does he have, like, super-gross hands...
...that look like they're made
out of big pink sausages?
Like eagle talons mixed with squid?
Wait. You've seen the...?
Whoa!
That's what I was just thinking about.
How did you...?
I had this weird dream
when I touched the Piece.
Well, I mean, I wasn't asleep,
so it wasn't really a dream.
Emmet, you had a vision.
I did?
MasterBuilders spend years...
...training themselves
to clear their minds enough...
...to have even a fleeting glimpse
of The Man Upstairs...
...and yet, your mind is already
so prodigiously empty...
...that there is nothing in it
to clear away in the first place.
With proper training...
...you could become a great MasterBuilder.
I could?
The prophecy chose you, Emmet.
But I can't do any of the stuff...
...that the prophecy
says I'm supposed to do.
All you have to do is to believe.
Then...
...you will see everything.
Are you ready, my son?
Yes, I am.
I think.
Then we haven't a moment to lose.
We must assemble...
...the MasterBuilders.
Do you think Zeppelins
are a bad investment?
Any of you fellas seen this guy?
Wait a minute, partner.
Draw a cowboy hat on him.
These mechanical birds
will get our message out.
They will go to an Internet caf...
...and e-mail the remaining MasterBuilders...
...who will meet us in the secret realm
of Cloud Cuckooland.
Cuckooland? Wait.
What happened to that whole training part?
Don't worry, Emmet.
Your training begins now.
Piano man...
...open up.
Your training begins later!
On three.
One...
- Whew. I think we're in the clear.
Freeze, turkeys.
All I want is the Piece of Resistance.
We would rather he died than give it to you.
I would not rather he died.
Look, everybody, we can do this
the easy way, or we can do it...
Go, run!
They took the hard way. Fire!
Fire!
Vitruvius, which way to Cloud Cuckooland?
Head for the big bright thing in the sky.
You mean the sun?
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
Let's get out of here. Here, use this.
What? Wait, hey...
- What are you doing? Aah!
Let's go!
I don't know what I'm doing.
Goodbye.
Boom!
Oh, dang!
Aah! I've got pigs! I hate pigs!
Quit playing around in the mud.
I could use your help.
Wyldstyle, we could really use...
...your help!
Oink, oink, oink.
Oink!
Vitruvius, they're
gaining on us. Build something!
Let Emmet try!
No, let's not let Emmet try!
I haven't had any training.
That's okay.
We'll start with
how to become a MasterBuilder.
Step one: Trust your instincts.
Okay, okay. Um...
Build something! Build something!
Aha. Take that!
Unless your instincts are terrible.
No! The wheel!
I can't control it much longer!
Emmet, we need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.
Um...
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.
We need to attach the wheel
to something that spins around.
Something that spins around.
Spins around. Spins around.
Oh.
Emmet, where are you going?
Oh, this better work.
Hang tight!
Dagnabit!
Well done, Emmet.
Hey! I did it.
Wow. You actually did it.
Train!
Oh, no.
Get off my train.
Run!
Wyldstyle!
Owie!
He's gonna ram us.
Quick, quick, quick! That piece!
Give me that piece.
Huh?
Build a ramp!
What the heck?
Rest in pieces.
- Uh...
- Oh, no.
Wait. No, no, no.
Hey.
Thanks for saving my life back there.
Even if, you know...
...eventually it turned out to be pointless.
Well, for what it's worth...
...this has been about the greatest
15 minutes of my life.
What the...?
Relax, everybody, I'm here.
Batman!
- What's up, babe?
Babe!
- What?
- Oh, sorry. Batman, this is Emmet.
Emmet, this is my boyfriend, Batman.
I'm Batman.
That's your boyfriend? Aah!
Batman, huh? Where'd you guys meet?
It's actually a funny story, right, Bat?
There he is.
- "Police" to meet you, Bad Cop.
- Batman!
The pleasure...
...is all "spine. "
Guess what...
...you big dumb baby.
Your car is a baby carriage.
Oh, no, your boyfriend's gone.
Hey, babe.
- What?
Let's hold hands.
So, uh...
Hey, guys, I think we're about
to crash into the sun.
Yeah, but it's gonna look really cool.
Uh, is this Cloud Cuckooland?
I don't see any clouds.
- Or cuckoos.
- No, no, this is...
...Middle Zealand.
A wondrous land...
...full of knights, castles, mutton...
...torture weapons, poverty,
leeches, illiteracy...
...and, um...
Dragon!
Yeah, that too.
Once we arrive at Cloud Cuckooland,
we'll raise an army...
...of MasterBuilders to...
Anyway, you guys gotta check out
these new subwoofers I installed.
I call them the dogs. Listen to them bark!
Can you turn that down a little bit?
This is a song I wrote for Wyldstyle.
Darkness
It's about how I'm an orphan.
No parents
This is real music, Emmet.
Batman's a true artist. Dark, brooding.
Well, I'm dark and brooding too.
Guys, look, a rainbow.
So you're gonna drive up the curved part...
Super rich
...take it all the way to the top...
Kind of makes it better
...and park the car.
Friends, welcome
to Cloud Cuckooland. Now...
I just need to give the secret knock.
Okay.
I'm just gonna come right out.
I have no idea what's going on...
...or what this place is at all.
Hi! I am Princess Unikitty...
...and I welcome you all
to Cloud Cuckooland.
There's no signs or anything.
How does anyone know what not to do?
Here in Cloud Cuckooland...
...there are no rules.
There's no government...
...no babysitters...
...no bedtimes...
...no frowny faces...
...no bushy mustaches...
...and no negativity of any kind.
You just said the word "no"
like a thousand times.
And there's also no consistency.
I hate this place.
Any idea is a good idea...
...except the not happy ones.
Those you push down deep inside...
...where you'll never, ever, ever...
...ever...
...find them.
Your fellow MasterBuilders
are gathered in the Dog.
The what?
Ah! Is that Superman?
Girl, what are you doing?
- Hey, Superman!
- Oh, hey. What's up?
- Lantern. Green Lantern.
- Yeah, yeah.
You wanna sit together at the meeting?
Um, I have to go back to Krypton.
Didn't Krypton blow up?
My fellow MasterBuilders,
including but not limited to...
...Robin Hood, Mermaid Lady...
...Gandalf...
...Swamp Creature...
...1980-something Space Guy...
- Hello!
...2002 NBA All-Stars...
...and Wonder Woman.
- Unh!
You have traveled far to be here
for a moment of great import.
We have learned...
...that Lord Business plans to unleash...
...a fully weaponized Kragle...
...on Taco Tuesday...
...to end the world as we know it.
Please, calm yourselves.
Green Ninja...
...Milhouse...
...Nice Vampire...
...Michelangelo, Michelangelo...
...and Cleopatra.
There is yet one hope.
The Special has arisen.
Have the young man step forward.
As you wish, Dubbledore.
I'm Gandalf!
- It's pronounced "Dumbledore. "
- Dubbadore?
No, "Dumbledore. "
Thought you said "Dubbadore. "
Vitruvius!
You gotta write that down.
I'm not gonna remember any of it.
But here we go.
The Special will now give
an eloquent speech.
Go ahead, man. You got this.
Okay.
Hello. I'm Emmet.
Oh, and this is the Piece of Resistance.
Thank you.
Well, uh, I know that I, for one...
...am very excited to work with you guys...
...to get into the Octan Tower,
find the Kragle...
...and put this thing on the thing.
And I know it's going to be really hard, but...
"Really hard"?
Wiping ye bum with a hook
for a hand is really hard.
This be impossible.
The last time we tried to storm
Lord Business' office...
...we used every plan we could conceive.
The result was a massacre
too terrible to speak of.
Who are you?
The name be Metal Beard.
And I'll tell you me tale of woe.
Oh, great, here we go again.
I arrived...
...at the foot of the Tower...
...with me hearty MasterBuilder crew...
...only to fnd the Kragle was all
the way up on the infnityeth floor...
...guarded by a robot army...
...and security measures...
...of every kind...
...imaginable:
Lasers...
...sharks...
...laser sharks...
...overbearing assistants...
...and strange, dangerous relics...
...that entrap...
...snap...
...and zap.
And there be a mysterious room
called the Think Tank.
I barely made it out of that...
...room...
...with just me head!
And organs.
Okay.
I had to replace every part
of my once-strapping...
...virile pirate body...
...with this useless hunk of garbage
ye see before ye.
So if ye think
it'd be a good idea to return...
...to that forsaken place...
...Special...
...what idea have ye that be better...
...than the ideas of 100...
...of our fallen MasterBuilder brothers?
Well, uh...
Well, technically I'm not exactly
a MasterBuilder yet.
What?
Please! Everyone! Please!
Rubbish!
Yes, it's true.
I may not be a MasterBuilder.
I may not have a lot of experience...
...fighting or leading
or coming up with plans.
Or having ideas in general.
In fact, I'm not all that smart.
And I'm not what you'd call
a "creative type. "
Plus...
...generally unskilled.
Also...
...scared and cowardly.
I know what you're thinking:
"He is the least qualified person...
...in the world to lead us. "
And you are right.
This is supposed to make us feel better?
No, there was about to be a "but. "
- You're a butt!
- Yes.
You all be on your own!
I be leaving this lost cause!
Why are you leaving?
A house divided against itself
would be better...
...than this.
Abraham Lincoln!
You bring your space chair right back here!
Come on, guys!
We can still do this. Right?
You're not even a bit special.
Well, you were right about him
being a ding-dong.
You're a huge disappointment.
Get him out of here.
I don't wanna look at him.
Well, at least it can't get any worse.
I was wrong.
It's the Orb of Tee-ti-list!
Ruh-roh. It's the bad guys.
Whoa. How did he...?
Go! Run! Come on, everyone!
Protect The Special.
What's that on his ankle?
It's a tracking device.
Take the MasterBuilders prisoner.
Oh, he led them right to us.
Guys, no, no, no. It's not my fault.
You are the worst leader I've ever seen.
To the Batmobile!
Dang it.
To the invisible jet!
- Dang it!
- Every man for himself.
No, we must protect the Piece.
Shaq, do you know what time...
...it is?
- It's game time.
Y'all ready for this?
Oh, no! They were ready for that.
It didn't break!
Because it's Kragled. Machine gum!
Fire!
No!
Aah! I can't move!
Don't worry, Superman.
- I'll get you out of there.
- No! Don't!
Aah! Oh, my gosh. My hands are stuck.
My legs are stuck as well.
I super hate you.
- Ow! You're pulling my torso off.
- Babe...
...help me get him out of here.
I said "every man for himself. "
Hey, you gotta be there for me.
Fine!
Fine. Fine. Fine.
- I need you to have a better attitude.
- I have a great...
...attitude.
- Ouch.
The Special's in the northwest quadrant.
We've got him cornered.
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch.
Where'd he go?
Oh, no!
They've hit our silly cloud stabilizers!
Let's go!
We need to get Emmet out of here.
Can't we build something?
- Hey! I'm Ben. But you can call me Benny.
I can build a spaceship. Watch.
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship
Spaceship, spaceship
No! You can't. The skies are surrounded.
That's okay. I didn't really wanna build...
...a spaceship anyway. That's cool.
Where can we go
where we can't be found?
Maybe we could go underwater?
What if we went underwater?
Great idea, babe!
Thank you, Batman.
Your ideas are the best.
But I just said that.
- We could build a submarine.
- A Bat-Submarine, patent pending.
With rainbows!
And dream catchers, in case we take a nap.
Like an underwater spaceship!
But you can't build all of them at once.
Ready? Break.
Okay.
These are the colors I need:
Blue razzleberry and sour apple!
If anybody has black parts,
I need them, okay?
I only work in black.
And sometimes, very, very dark gray.
- Use the yellow bricks!
- Hey, guys, can I help?
No! It has to be this way!
No, I need that!
Where is he?
Anyone know what this is,
and do you need it?
I think we could use wings
and rocket boosters.
Ew. Get your retro space stuff
out of my area.
You guys, hey, just tell me exactly
what to do. And how to do it.
Emmet, don't worry about
what the others are doing.
You must embrace
what is special about you!
There he is!
All units, attack the sub!
Emmet, get in here!
Stop him! Stop him! Don't let him...
...get to the water!
Dive, dive, dive! Everybody in!
We're going under!
Oh, no.
My home.
It's gone.
I feel something inside.
It's like the opposite of happiness.
I must stay positive.
Ah. Bubble gums.
Butterflies.
Cotton candy.
Gosh, I'm so sorry, Unikitty.
Do you want to sit down
and talk about it?
What the heck is that?
It's a double-decker couch.
Which seemed like a good idea
at the time...
...but I now realize it's not super helpful.
But, you know, it has cup holders.
Seats flip up with coolers underneath.
You are so disappointing
on so many levels.
- Why are my pants cold and wet?
- Ew.
Uh...
Hull breach.
The walls are crying!
We're coming apart at the seams!
This is not how Batman dies.
Emmet!
- Hold on, hold on!
- Wyldstyle!
Deep breath! Deep breath, everybod...!
Micro-managers,
what's going on down there?
Scanning submarine wreckage.
No survivors detected.
Scuba cops,
dredge the entire ocean if you have to.
We have got to find that Piece.
Let's get these prisoners
back to Lord Business...
...and give him the good news.
The Special is no more.
Hello, everybody!
Superman. Wonder Woman,
I had no idea you'd be here.
Mr. Shaquille O'Neal.
Greetings, all!
Welcome to my Think Tank.
Help us!
All the MasterBuilders
you've captured over the years...
...you've brought them here.
You're a very perceptive person, Superman.
They come up with all the instructions
for everything in the universe.
Robots!
No! No! Grr!
Can't get much worse than this.
Uh, hello, neighbor.
- Oh, no.
It's Green Lantern.
Oh, my gosh, we're roommates!
How crazy is that?
Does anyone have some Kryptonite
that they could give me?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where is The Special?
The Special and the Piece of Resistance
are at the bottom of the ocean.
Wait, are you telling me
you don't have him?
Sir, my scuba team is looking
for his remains as we speak.
Bad Cop, he could still be alive!
The Piece could still be out there.
The only remnant of The Special
was a double-decker couch.
Wait, hold on.
A double-decker couch?
Yes, sir.
Really? So it's like a bunk-bed couch?
Is that what it's like?
That's weird.
If you're sitting in the top middle...
...how are you gonna get down
without climbing over someone?
If you're sitting on the bottom
and you're watching TV...
...are you gonna have to watch
through a bunch of dangling legs?
Who's gonna want to sit on the bottom?
It is literally...
...the most useless idea
I have ever heard.
- Well, we're still alive.
- Yeah!
Heh. The double-decker couch.
It wasn't totally pointless after all.
It's the one thing that stayed together.
I always believed in you, Emmet.
I don't mean to spoil the party,
but does anyone else notice...
...we're stuck in the middle
of the ocean on this couch?
I mean, it's not like a big gigantic ship...
...is gonna come out of nowhere
and save us...
My gosh!
Avast, mateys!
Metal Beard, I thought you said
we were a lost cause!
Ye are!
Did ye not hear me whole story...
...circumscribing the folly
of this whole enterprise?
Well, it's kind of hard not to hear
when you're yelling everything.
So why did you come back?
This be-doubled land couch.
I watched Lord Business' forces
completely overlook it.
Which means we need more ideas like it!
Oh, thank you.
Ideas so dumb and bad...
...that no one would ever think
they could possibly be useful.
Oh. Thank you.
So, Special, what do we do?
Uh...
Well...
...what's the last thing Lord Business
expects MasterBuilders will do?
Build a spaceship?
Kill a chicken?
Marry a marshmallow.
Why, this:
How you gonna keep 'em down on the farm?
No! It's follow the instructions.
- Don't like that.
- Sounds weird.
Now, listen. Wait, listen.
Guys, you're all so talented
and imaginative.
But you can't work together as a team.
I'm just a construction worker.
But when I had a plan and we were
all working together...
...I mean, we could build a skyscraper.
Now, you're MasterBuilders.
Just imagine what could happen
if you did that.
You could save the universe.
Well said, Emmet. Well said.
Really?
She be a fine speech there, laddie.
Okay.
Somebody get me some markers...
...some construction paper...
...and some glitter glue!
I call this:
"Emmet's plan to get
inside the Tower...
...put the Piece of Resistance
on the Kragle...
...and save the world. "
I've built a hundred just like them
back in the city.
If we can just get in, I know where
the air ducts and wiring are located.
I can get us anywhere.
How will we get inside?
In a spaceship.
- Spaceship! Ha, ha!
- Great idea. A Bat-Spaceship.
No, they're expecting us to show up...
...in a Bat-Spaceship, or a pirate spaceship
or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship.
One of those sounds awesome to me.
My idea is to build a spaceship...
...that's exactly like all the other
Octan delivery spaceships.
So not the special spaceship that
I'm building for all of you right now?
Sorry, Benny. Maybe next time.
Ooh, you're really letting the oxygen
out of my tank here.
Yeah, but according
to your precious instructions...
...this ship needs a hyperdrive.
We don't have that part.
Maybe we could find one!
What do you think, a spaceship
is just gonna appear out of the blue?
Are you kidding me?
The same thing!
- Chewie!
- Mm!
We're supposed to be halfway
to Naboo for a sweet party!
This hyperdrive keeps malfunctioning...
...taking us to loser systems like this.
Captain Solo, we must go.
You know how perturbed I get
if we are not punctual.
The Droid's right. Let's roll.
Now hold on, Han.
This might be the right galaxy after all.
Because I see a heavenly body.
Ooh, whoa, I have a boyfriend.
And it is super serious. Right, babe?
- Of course it's serious.
- Yeah!
- Got room forjust one dude?
- Whoa! Babe!
If he's a cool dude like you.
You're trying to bail on us!
I'm not trying to bail!
You asked them if you could go
with them on their party ship!
That thing is filled with bon vivants.
You speak French now?
Babe, look, if this relationship
is ever gonna work between us...
...I need to feel free to party...
...with a bunch of strangers
whenever I feel like it.
What?
Babe!
I will text you.
Where'd you get that
sweet space cape, brother?
It's party time!
Babe?
Wyldstyle, you're such an amazing person.
And, you know,
if Batman can't see that, then he's just...
Well, he's just as blind as a guy...
...whose eyes stopped working.
And I'm gonna tell you something:
Batman is the worst person I've ever met.
- Need a hyperdrive?
- No way.
- Babe!
- I knew it! I knew that.
You really had me there!
Those guys were so lame.
All they did was play space checkers.
Plus, it turns out the hairy one's a dude.
And the metal one too. All dudes.
But won't they notice
their hyperdrive is missing?
Come on, Chewie, hit the hyperdrive.
Nah, they'll be fine.
Step one:
All right, we need a red four-piece
unit over at the...
Unikitty...
...you're supposed to follow
the instructions, remember?
Sorry.
Ugh, this gives me the jeebies.
What do I even...? I can't...!
Nice!
Step two:
We pilot the ship to the service entrance...
...so we can get past the dangerous...
...but also kind of cool...
...laser gate.
Space ID.
I have a drive-on.
Who are you here to see?
I'm here to see Your Butt.
Is that last name "Butt,"
first name "Your," or is it...?
Oh, my gosh!
Pow. Wham. Ka-zap.
First try!
Step three:
We break into Lord Business' office...
...and we'll plunder his collection
of relics for disguises.
Step four:
Benny and Metal Beard...
...will sneak their way
into the master control room.
Motion sensors triggered in Sector 12.
10-4.
Uh-oh.
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Oh!
Do it.
Metal Beard, that was awesome!
First law of the sea...
...never place your rear end
on a pirate's face.
Once inside,
they'll use their technical know-how...
...to disable the Kragle shield.
I am the computer.
Cool! Talking computer.
Please disable the shield systems.
Of course.
There are no movies
in your area with that title.
Step fve:
Vitruvius will provide lookout
and make sure we're not being followed.
Okay.
Step six:
Batman and Unikitty go into the boardroom...
...to make one last change
to Lord Business'plan.
I move that we freeze the universe.
Can I get a second on that?
I second.
Bruce Wayne, CEO of Wayne Enterprises.
Bruce Wayne? Uh, who's that?
Sounds like a cool guy.
We'd like to invest in your company.
Your weapon to control
the universe sounds super sweet...
...I must say.
- It is, indeed, super sweet.
Cool. What kind of sound system
does it have?
Uh, sound system?
Well, I mean, we have an iPod Shuffle.
Wait a second.
You're telling me you have
a machine to control the universe...
...and you can't listen to tunes
in surround sound?
Embarrassing.
Well, I mean...
...we need to get that done.
I want eight-foot speakers.
Great call.
Yeah, I want speakers that you can hug
with your arms and your legs...
...and just feel the beat.
Listen up! We need new instructions
for a speaker system for the TAKOS.
We'll never help.
Whatever you say, boss.
Then once the instructions are printed...
...Wyldstyle and I
will enter the Kragle room...
...place the thing on the other thing...
...and save the universe.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, I didn't draw that.
Is that me exploding?
Uh, I didn't mention that earlier?
When you reunite the Piece
with the Kragle, it might explode?
No! But it might not, right?
Sure, sure, sure. Let's go with that.
Attention, everybody!
Incoming speaker delivery!
Ow!
Who are you two?
We are transfers from downstairs.
- What?
- Excuse me?
Your robot voice
sounds an awful lot like a human voice.
Give me a break.
I've never been a robot before.
What do you mean?
You have always been a robot!
No, no, no, do not listen to her.
What are your robot serial numbers?
Everything is awesome
No way. This is my jam.
This is also my jam.
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team
- Needs great harmonies.
- I don't want to sing the song. I'm not...
Everything is awesome
Everything is cool
When you're part of a team
Everything is awesome
When we're living our dream
Quick, let's go.
Everything is awesome
Hmm, I thought you didn't like that song.
I don't.
Mm-hm.
I know you put on this tough act...
...but I don't think you're as mean
as you're trying to seem.
I'm not mean. What are you talking about?
I'm just saying, you were all,
"He's not The Special, Vitruvius.
He can't possibly be The Special.
This guy? Are you kidding me?"
Anyways, I don't think that's you.
The real you, anyway.
Look, Emmet.
I wanted it to be me, okay?
I wanted to be The Special.
And I know that sounds super mature.
It's just...
...ever since I heard the prophecy,
I wanted to be the One.
I was right there in that construction site...
...right on top of it, and then...
...it turned out to be you.
That night in the city,
when you thought I was The Special...
...and you said I was talented
and important...
...that was the first time anyone
had ever really told me that.
And it made me
wanna do everything I could...
...to be the guy you were talking about.
Lucy.
What?
That was my real name.
You asked earlier, and it's...
...Lucy.
I really like that name.
Hey.
- What are you two losers talking about?
- Huh? What? Oh, nothing.
Thought I'd help you guys.
Left the weird cat thing to stall.
Business, business, business. Numbers.
- Is this working?
Yes.
Yay!
There's Bad Cop.
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes...
Okay. Wait for my signal.
Good luck, Emmet.
Lucy.
I guess this might be goodbye.
I don't like goodbyes.
Let's just call this:
"See you later, alligator. "
"See you later, alligator"?
After a while, crocodile.
Who's Lucy?
Batman, when we get inside this room...
...there are gonna be
audio sensors everywhere.
We have to be really, really quiet.
Don't worry, Dad, I read your dumb
instructions. Stop yelling at me.
Benny, what's our status with the shield?
Oh, yeah, no, it's going great.
It's just going great,
if somebody would listen to me!

getting "pants" from? You know what I want!
The pipes are calling...
Bad Cop.
Hi, this is Lord Business'assistant.
He would like you to come
to his office immediately.
Copy that.
- Thanks.
- You are welcome, sir.
Hey, who is that?
That's the signal...
...but the shield is still up.
We'll wing it.
That's a bat pun.
Shh. Benny...
...disable the shield.
Disable the shield.
Now.
Disable the shield.
- Searching for Albanian restaurants.
- What?
No! I never once said anything...!
I don't understand what you mean.
Disable the shield!
Benny, what's going on?
Disable the shield! Come on!
You are undermining me!
Which phrase
would you like me to underline?
Disable the shield!
Let me try.
Be ye disabling of yon shield.
Disabling shield.
What?
Okay, in three...
...two...
...one.
Let's do this.
Lucy!
Lucy!
No!
Oh, man.
Oh, no.
Uh-oh.
Sneaking around the corner...
- Unh!
- Vitruvius.
I see you've accidentally
wandered into my Think Tank.
And by the way,
I found a few of your friends.
- By which I mean all of them!
- Sorry!
Acceptable work, Bad Cop.
Thank you, sir.
Robots, destroy this old man at once.
Did you just call me "old"?
Yeah. So what?
Well, Junebug, I really prefer the word...
..."experienced"!
Aha.
You see, Emmet?
A corrupted spirit is no match
for the purity of imagina...
- Ha-ha-ha!
Vitruvius!
No!
Vitruvius.
My sweet Emmet. Come closer.
You must know something
about the prophecy.
I know, I'm doing my best...
...but I don't...
The prophecy...
I made it up.
What?
I made it up. It's not true.
But that means I'm just...
I'm not The Special?
You must listen.
What I'm about to tell you...
...will change the course of history.
No.
No.
Hey.
Not so special anymore, huh?
Well, guess what.
No one ever told me I was special.
I never got a trophy just for showing up!
I'm not some special little snowflake...
...no.
But as unspecial as I am...
...you are a thousand-billion times...
...more unspecial than me.
Robots, bring me the Sword of Exact Zero.
Yes, Lord Business.
It must be weird.
One minute, you're the most
special person in the universe.
And the next minute, you're nobody.
Oh, I have a nice spot
for this in my relic room.
Uh-oh! My mistake!
There it goes!
No!
Bye-bye forever!
Well, I guess
there's only one thing left to do!
Release the Kragle!
- Computer!
- Yes, sir.
Set the electric shocker to 100 Mississippi.
No problem.
- Then terminate everyone.
- Already on it.
Emmet, that should give you enough time...
...to witness the first location to be Kragled.
- Your hometown.
- No!
Bad Cop, unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to leave you here to die.
What? Sir.
It's not personal.
It's just business.
Lord Business.
Ciao.
Beginning zapping termination...
...in 99 Mississippi...
...98 Mississippi...
...97 Mississippi...
...and so on.
Attention, everyone.
This is President Business.
Hello.
- Hi, welcome to Taco Tuesday!
- Whoa.
Don't worry about this big black...
...monolith thing that's blocking out the sun.
What you need to worry about...
...is this question that I'm about to ask you:
Who wants a taco?
Yeah! I know!
Tacos, tacos! We're going crazy! Yeah.
All right, everyone.
Act normal.
Perfect.
Now, everybody say "Freeze!"
So I guess running around
and screaming is normal.
Micro-managers,
commence micro-management.
Commencing micro-management.
What's going on? I can't move!
Please, please! Won't somebody help us?
Emmet, you'll think of something,
right? Like you always do.
Didn't you hear him?
The prophecy's made-up.
I'm not The Special.
And to think for a moment
I thought I might be.
Emmet.
- Who said that?
I did.
I am Ghost Vitruvius.
Woo!
Emmet, you didn't let me finish earlier.
Because I died.
The reason I made up the prophecy...
...was because I knew that
whoever found the Piece...
...could become The Special.
Because the only thing
anyone needs to be special...
...is to believe that you can be.
I know that sounds like a cat poster,
but it's true.
Look at what you did
when you believed you were special.
You just need to believe it some more.
But how can I just decide
to believe that I'm special...
...when I'm not?
Because the world depends on it.
Woo!
Zapping termination in 35 Mississippi...
What?
...34 Mississippi...
...33 Mississippi...
...32 Mississippi...
...31 Mississippi...
...30 Mississippi...
...29 Mississippi...
...28 Mississippi, 27 Mississippi...
...26 Mississippi...
...25 Mississippi...
...24 Mississippi...
Emmet!
What are you...?
18 Mississippi...
...17 Mississippi...
Oh!
...16 Mississippi...
- Lucy!
...15 Mississippi...
- Wait! What are you...?
Now it's your turn to be the hero.
13 Mississippi...
- No!
...12 Mississippi...
See you later, alligator.
Don't!
No, Emmet!
- Aah!
7 Mississippi...
...6 Mississippi...
...5 Mississippi...
...4 Mississippi...
...3 Mississippi...
...2 Mississippi...
...1 Mississippi...
...0 Missi... Error.
Termination failure.
Emmet!
No.
He... He saved us.
Well, what do we do now?
There's gotta be a bright side...
...here somewhere.
Does anyone have any ideas?
Emmet had ideas.
Arr, if only there were more people
in the world like he.
Maybe there are.
Meet me downstairs in 10 seconds.
Honey, where are my...
...pant...?
- Hi!
Hey, guess what.
Found your pants. Series is over. Benny...
...send this out to everyone in the universe.
1980-something technology?
Now you're talking!
Uh... Ahem. Hey, everybody.
You don't know me,
but I'm on TV, so you can trust me.
I know things seem kind of bad right now.
But there is a way out of this.
This is Emmet.
And he was just like all of you.
A face in the crowd...
...following the same instructions as you.
He was so good at ftting in,
no one ever saw him.
And I owe you an apology...
...because I used to look down
on people like that.
"I used to think they were followers...
...with no ideas or vision. "
Because it turns out Emmet had great ideas.
And even though they seemed weird...
...and kind of pointless...
...they actually came closer...
...than anyone else to saving the universe.
And now we have to fnish what he started...
...by making whatever weird thing
pops into our heads.
All of you have the ability
inside of you to be a groundbreaker.
And I mean literally!
Break the ground!
Peel up the pieces...
...tear apart your walls!
Build things only you could build.
Defend yourselves.
We need to fght back
against President Business'...
...plans to freeze us!
Today will not be known as Taco Tuesday.
It will be known as Freedom Friday!
But still on a Tuesday!
End of the line.
Bad Cop?
I hope there's still a Good Cop
in me somewhere.
I'll hold these guys off.
You go stop them. Yay!
Great idea, but how will we get there?
T- minus one.
Ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six...
- I could, uh...
...fve, four...
- I could build a...
...three, two, one.
I could build a spaceship!
You're not gonna say no?
Build away, whatever your name is.
- Whoa! Yay!
- Ha-ha-ha!
Okay. Spaceship! Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
Spaceship!
All units, attack that spaceship.
Spaceship!
Where'd he go?
Spaceship!
Wyldstyle, look...
...it's the citizens!
Tallyho!
Yee-haw!
And don't forget us MasterBuilders.
What is going on?
You stop...
...building that stuff!
Just stop it!
Greatjob!
This might actually work.
'Twas your speech
which roused this hearty crew.
If only Emmet were here to see this.
He'd say something adorable like...
Am I just gonna keep...
...falling...
...forever?
Is this another vision?
Where am I?
Is that the Office Tower?
Bricksburg!
What was that?
No, no, no.
No!
Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!
- Pew!
What in the world is that?
It's adorable.
Uh-oh.
No. No. Whoa, no, no, no.
Hey, don't eat me. Don't eat me.
Do not eat me. Please.
Hi, Emmet.
Uh...
Hi?
Is this The Man...?
The Man Upstairs?
What happened?
No, no, no, this is a disaster.
Why...? Why...? What? What?
What?
Why is the dragon on top
of the luxury condo development?
But I was just playing...
I know it's hard to understand...
...but this is Dad's stuff, okay?
All of this that you see before you...
...is all your father's.
And everything is thought-out very...
What did you do down here?
Did you take the top off of the tower?
It was an accident.
You accidentally...
...expertly...
...carefully took the entire top
off of that tower?
Yes.
You know the rules. This isn't a toy.
- Um, well, it kind of is.
- No.
Actually, it's a highly sophisticated
interlocking brick system.
- But we bought it at the toy store.
- We did.
But the way I'm using it
makes it an adult thing.
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14.
That's a suggestion.
They have to put that on there.
You can't expect me to be able
to resist playing with all this.
You have your stuff over near
the Christmas decorations.
All those bricks,
you can build anything you want.
Finn, we're gonna play a little game.
It's called:
"Let's Put Everything Back
the Way You Found It. "
But, Dad, you don't understand.
So I can make things
the way they're supposed to be.
Permanently.
More Kragles?
This rebellion ends right now.
Commencing...
...micro-management.
Oh, no. No!
Ha, ha! Fire in the hole!
Wait, what's happening?
No, wait! No, we're going down!
Mayday!
No!
Meow. Meow.
Hold on, Jeff. We're coming for you!
No!
Stop!
Oh, no!
Arr, there be too many Micro-managers!
What am I holding here?
- It's a battleship.
- No, it's a hodgepodge. That's what it is.
What's Batman doing on it?
What is this, a robot pirate?
Dang it.
Stop! Stop it! No! Stop it! Stop!
You got glue all over
that construction worker.
Here. Give that to me.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
All of those are my friends! No, stop it!
Ye were a hearty crew. But it be...
It be over.
No!
The Piece of Resistance!
I can still save them!
Let's get this gunk
off this construction worker.
He's notjust a construction worker, Dad.
He's the hero.
Nope, he's not.
He is a ordinary, regular...
...generic construction worker...
...and I need to put him back
where he belongs.
Now, where is my X-Acto knife?
I gotta get the Piece of Resistance.
If I could get the attention
of the smaller creature...
I gotta move.
Where is that?
Move!
All right.
Move!
Now, I didn't move...
Ow.
Uh, Dad?
- Yeah.
I think I saw the X-Acto over there
near Middle Zealand.
Oh, great. Thank you.
Welcome.
It's up to you now, Emmet.
Believe.
I know that sounds like a cat poster...
...but it's true.
Whoa!
Sorry, street.
Ho-ho!
I can see everything.
Ha, ha!
What the heck is this?
I am a MasterBuilder.
Release every Micro-manager we have!
Let's get him, fellas!
Hey, everyone!
- Emmet!
- Emmet! Yay!
Lucy, I'm going inside that thing.
You've got it, Emmet.
Take that! Ha, ha!
Good night! Come here!
We'll help you out, kid.
Here's how we do it pirate-style!
Yes! Emmet! That's it!
Take him down, boys!
Emmet!
Stay positive.
They're tearing me apart!
Stay positive.
Come on!
Oh, forget it!
You all need to be more friendly!
Emmet, go!
Go! Now's your...
...chance!
She's right!
- You can do it, me laddie!
Go on, kid. Get in there!
Sir, we got an intrud...!
Lord Business.
Back from the dead, Brickowski?
Well, you're too late!
Skeletrons, get him!
Argh! I can't move!
You see, your friends...
...oh, they're fnished!
My world is almost fnished.
The last thing I need to do is finish...
...you.
- No, stop! Please!
If you do one more thing,
I'm gonna unleash my secret weapon.
Your secret weapon?
Yes, it's called:
The Power of The Special.
That sounds dumb.
All right, here it comes.
My secret weapon...
...is this.
What is that? Is it super small?
I don't see anything.
It's my hand. I want you to take it.
You want me to take your hand off?
No, I want you to join me.
Look at all of these things that people built.
You might see a mess...
Exactly. And a bunch
of weird, dorky stuff...
...that ruined my perfectly good stuff!
Okay. What I see...
...are people inspired by each other...
...and by you.
People taking what you made...
...and making something new out of it.
Finn, did you make all of this?
The people are trying to stop
President Business...
...from using the Kragle.
What's the Kragle?
Um, it's in there.
In here?
So President Business is the bad guy?
Lf...
If the construction guy...
...said something
to President Business...
...what would he say?
You...
...don't have to be...
...the bad guy.
You...
...are the most talented...
...most interesting...
...and most extraordinary person
in the universe.
And you are capable of amazing things...
...because you are The Special.
And so am I.
And so is everyone.
The prophecy is made-up...
...but it's also true.
It's about all of us.
Right now, it's about you.
And you...
...still...
...can change everything.
Oh, we got a hugger.
Be careful.
I have been told it might explode.
Phew.
Emmet, thank you.
And I just want you to know,
from the bottom of my heart...
...from this moment forward...
...I solemnly promise that I will never...
Emmet!
Hey, everyone! Is everyone okay?
Where's Lucy?
Emmet!
Lucy!
We did it.
Oh. Uh, Emmet, wait.
Batman, there's something
I need to say to you.
No. Wyldstyle...
I mean...
...Lucy.
He's the hero you deserve.
Uh...
- Thanks, Batman.
I liked Emmet before it was cool.
Whoops, I have the antidote for the Kragle.
How did that happen?
Yay!
- De-Kragler.
Watch this.
- Yay!
- Oh, Mommy, Daddy.
You're okay!
- Oh, son!
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
We're okay, son. Ha, ha.
Guys, time to come up for dinner.
It's Taco Tuesday, your favorite.
- Okay, honey. We'll be up in a sec.
- Yeah, we'll be up in a sec!
- I gotta tell you something.
What?
Now that I'm letting you
come down here and play...
...guess who else gets to
come down here and play?
- Who?
- Your sister.
What?
Well, things sure have a way
of working out smoothly.
Am I right, guys?
What?
We're from the Planet Duplon.
We are here to destroy you.
Oh, man.
Yes, this is real music.
Dark, brooding...
...important...
...groundbreaking.
Check out the lyrics.
Darkness
No parents
Continued darkness
More darkness. Get it?
The opposite of light
Black hole
Curtains drawn
In the basement
Middle of the night
Blacked-out windows
Other places that are dark
Black suit
Black coffee
You get it. That's just the frst verse.
Darkness
No parents
Super rich
Kind of makes it better
Everything is awesome
Everything is...
Oh, hey. God, I still can't get that song
out of my head.
It's truly amazing how many LEGO fans
there are around the world...
...who love to create short films
using LEGO bricks.
The filmmakers of The LEGO Movie,
Chris and Phil...
...thought it would be fun to challenge
the ReBrick community...
That's LEGO's official
social media platform.
- To come up with an original brick film
between 15 and 30 seconds...
...with the winning entry being featured
during The LEGO Movie. How cool is that?
Look at all these things that people built.
Just to make it a bit more challenging,
entries had to incorporate the theme...
...of a LEGO mini figure changing up
their environment to fight off a bad guy.
Well, the ReBrick community went to work
and created some really fun...
...and really incredible mini movies
entirely made out of LEGO bricks.
We're giving you the opportunity
to see some of the top entries...
...along with the winning submissions.
So be ready to be blown away
by LEGO awesomeness.
Roll it.
Awesome.

All right, team,
stay in sight of each other.
Let's make NASA proud today.
How's it looking over there, Watney?
Well, you'll be happy to hear...
that in Grid Section 14-28,
the particles were predominantly coarse...
but in 29, they're much finer...
and they should be ideal
for chem analysis.
Wow. Did everybody hear that?
Mark just discovered dirt.
Should we alert the media?
Sorry, what are you
doing today, Martinez?
Making sure the MAV is still upright?
I'd like you to know that
visual inspection of the equipment...
is imperative to mission success.
I also would like to report
that the MAV is still upright.
Watney, you keep leaving
your channel open...
which leads to Martinez responding...
which leads to all of us listening...
which leads to me being annoyed.
Roger that.
Martinez, the captain would like you to please...
shut your smart mouth.
We'd prefer to use a different adjective
to describe Martinez's mouth.
Did Beck just insult me?
"Dr. Beck." And yes.
Happy to turn the radios off
from here, Commander.
Just say the word.
Wait, Johanssen.
Constant communication is the hallmark...
Shut 'em off.
No.
No. Excuse me.
I apologize for my countrymen, Vogel.
Accepted.
How many samples do we need, Commander?
Seven.
100 grams each.
We have a mission update.
A storm warning.
Commander, you should come inside.
You're gonna want to see this.
What is it?
A storm warning.
I saw that in this morning's briefing.
We'll be inside before it hits.
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.
Martinez, how does it look?
Not good.
"1,200 kilometers in diameter,
bearing 24.41 degrees."
That's tracking right towards us.
"Based on current escalation,
estimated force of 8,600 newtons."
What's the abort force?
7,500.
Anything more than that
and the MAV could tip.
Do we scrub?
Begin abort procedure.
We are estimating
with a margin of error.
We could wait it out.
Let's wait it out.
Let's wait it out.
Commander?
Prep emergency departure.
Commander?
We're scrubbed. That's an order.
Martinez, how long before take-off?
12 minutes.
Visibility is almost zero.
Anyone gets lost,
hone in on my suit's telemetry.
You ready?
Ready.
-Commander, are you okay?
-I'm okay.
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,
and the MAV is gonna tip at 12.3.
Hey! We might be able
to keep the MAV from tipping.
How?
Use the cables from the comms mast
as guy-lines...
anchor it with the Rover's.
Watch out!
Watney!
Warning. Suit breach detected.
What happened?
-He was hit.
-Watney, report.
Before we lost telemetry,
his decompression alarm went off.
-Where did you last see him?
-I don't know where he is.
-What are the vitals on his suit?
-He's offline.
A complete loss of signal on Watney.
-Beck!
-Yeah.
How long can he survive decompression?
Less than a minute.
Line up, walk west.
He may be prone.
We don't wanna step over him.
Commander...
We're at 10.5 degrees.
Warning. Excessive tilt.
Tilting to 11
with all the gusts of wind.
Copy that.
Everyone, hone in on Martinez's suit.
It'll get you to airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.
What about you, Commander?
I'm gonna search a little longer.
Get moving!
Go!
Watney!
Watney, report!
The MAV's at 11.6 degrees.
One good gust and we're tipping.
If it tips, you launch.
You really think
I'm gonna leave you behind?
That's an order, Martinez.
Mark!
Mark! Can you hear me?
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?
Could that detect Watney's suit?
It's made to see
the Hermes from orbit...
not a little piece of metal
from a single suit.
Give it a try.
Roger.
What is she thinking? She knows
the infrared can't get through a sandstorm.
She's grasping for anything.
We've got negative contact
on the proximity radar.
Nothing?
No. I can barely see the Hab.
Commander, I know
you don't wanna hear this, but...
Mark is dead.
Commander!
Hey, what the hell
is wrong with you, man?
My friend just died.
I don't want my commander to die, too.
Stability warning.
We're tipping!
Commander, you need to get back
to the ship, now!
13 degrees.
If we pass balance,
we'll never rock back.
I've got one more trick left,
and then I'm following orders, Commander.
You're firing the OMS?
That's right.
Commander!
On my way.
Johanssen, let's go.
Mark!
We're at 11.5 and holding.
Ready to go on your command.
Ready to launch.
Commander.
I need you to verbally tell me
whether or not to.
Launch.
At around 4:30 a.m.
Central Standard Time...
our satellites detected a storm approaching
the Ares 3 mission site on Mars.
At 6:45,
the storm had escalated to severe...
and we had no choice
but to abort the mission.
Thanks to the quick action
of Commander Lewis...
astronauts Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel...
were all able to reach
the Mars Ascent Vehicle...
and perform an emergency launch
at 7:28 Central Time.
Unfortunately, during the evacuation...
astronaut Mark Watney
was struck by debris and killed.
Commander Lewis
and the rest of her team...
were able to intercept safely with
the Hermes and are now heading home.
But Mark Watney is dead.
Director Sanders!
Oxygen level critical.
Oxygen level critical.
Oxygen level...
Pressure stable.
Fuck.
Okay.
Okay.
Hello, this is Mark Watney, astronaut.
I'm entering this log for the record...
in case I don't make it.
It is 06:53 on Sol 19...
and I'm alive.
Obviously.
But I'm guessing that's gonna come as
a surprise to my crewmates and to NASA.
And to the entire world, really, so...
Surprise.
I did not die on Sol 18.
Best I can figure...
this length of our primary
communications antenna broke off...
and tore through my bio-monitor...
and ripped a hole in me as well.
But the antenna and the blood, really,
managed to seal the breach in my suit...
which kept me alive, even though
the crew must have thought I was dead.
I have no way to contact NASA.
And even if I could,
it's gonna be four years...
until a manned mission can reach me.
And I'm in a Hab designed
to last 31 days.
If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm gonna suffocate.
If the water reclaimer breaks,
I'll die of thirst.
If the Hab breaches,
I'm just gonna, kind of...
implode.
And if by some miracle,
none of that happens...
eventually I'm gonna run out of food.
So...
yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not gonna die here.
32...
33...
34...
35, 36.
Sweet and sour chicken.
What do we got?
Right, let's do the math.
Our surface mission here was
supposed to last 31 sols.
For redundancy, they sent 68 sols
worth of food. That's for 6 people.
So for just me,
that's gonna last 300 sols...
which I figure I can stretch to 400
if I ration.
So I got to figure out a way to grow
three years' worth of food here.
On a planet where nothing grows.
Luckily...
I'm a botanist.
Mars will come to fear my botany powers.
Pressure stable.
Staple came out.
Fuck you, Mars.
Johanssen, Jesus.
Sunday, Monday, Happy Days
Tuesday, Wednesday, Happy Days
Thursday, Friday, Happy Days
The weekend comes, my cycle hums
Ready to race to you
The problem is water.
I have created
126 square meters of soil.
But every cubic meter of soil requires
40 liters of water to be farmable.
So I gotta make a lot more water.
Good thing is, I know the recipe.
You take hydrogen,
you add oxygen, you burn.
Now, I have hundreds of liters
of unused hydrazine at the MDV.
If I run the hydrazine over an iridium catalyst,
it'll separate into N2 and H2.
And then if I just direct the hydrogen
into a small area...
and burn it.
Luckily, in the history of humanity...
nothing bad has ever happened
from lighting hydrogen on fire.
NASA hates fire.
Because of the whole "fire makes
everybody die in space" thing.
So, everything they sent us up here with
is flame-retardant...
with the notable exception of...
Martinez's personal items.
I am sorry, Martinez.
But if you didn't want me to
go through your stuff...
you shouldn't have left me for dead
on a desolate planet.
By the way, I'm figuring you're gonna be
fine with this, given my present situation.
What's everybody doing?
Taking a holiday from being cool?
Counting on you.
So, yeah, I blew myself up.
Best guess...
I forgot to
account for the excess oxygen...
that I've been exhaling
when I did my calculations.
Because I'm stupid.
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work here...
just as soon as my ears stop ringing.
Interesting side note, this is actually
how the Jet Propulsion Lab was founded.
Five guys at Caltech were trying
to make rocket fuel...
and they nearly burned down their dorm.
And rather than expel them...
they banished them to a nearby farm,
told them to keep working.
And now we have a space program.
Okay.
Hey, there.
The nation was blessed to have Mark
serving in our space program.
While his loss will be deeply felt...
the men and women of NASA
will soldier forth...
onward and upward in the mission
of their agency.
By doing so, they honor the legacy
Mark's leaving behind...
and they ensure his sacrifice
will not be in vain.
I have the honor of speaking not only
for the men and women of NASA...
but for people all over the world...
I thought you gave a lovely speech,
by the way.
I need you to authorize
my satellite time.
It's not gonna happen.
We're funded for five Ares missions.
I think I can get Congress
to authorize a sixth.
-No.
-Ares 3 evac'd after 18 sols.
There's half a mission worth
of supplies up there.
I can sell it at a fraction of the cost
of a normal mission...
and all I have to know is
what's left of our assets.
You're not the only one
who needs satellite time.
We've got the Ares 4 supply missions
coming up.
We should be focusing on
the Schiaparelli Crater.
Okay, we got 12 satellites up there.
Surely we can spare a few hours...
It's not about
the satellite time, Vince.
We're a public domain organization.
-We need to be transparent on this.
-Okay.
The second we point
the satellites at the Hab...
I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney's
dead body to the world.
You're afraid of a PR problem?
Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem.
Another mission?
Congress won't reimburse us
for a paper clip...
if I put a dead astronaut on the
front page of The Washington Post.
He's not going anywhere, Teddy.
I mean, he's not...
He's not gonna decompose, you know.
He's gonna be up there forever.
Meteorology estimates that
he'll be covered in sand...
from normal weather activity
within a year.
We can't wait a year.
We got work to do.
Ares 5 won't even launch for five years.
We have plenty of time.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, consider this.
Right now, the world's on our side.
Sympathy for the Watney family.
Ares 6 could bring his body home.
Now, we don't say that's
the purpose of the mission...
but we make it clear that
that would be a part of it.
We frame it that way.
More support from Congress.
But not if we wait a year.
We wait a year, nobody gives a shit.
Vincent Kapoor?
6-2.
7-6-2.
Acidalia Planitia.
What?
Hi. Security?
This is Mindy Park in SatCon.
I need the emergency contact
for Vincent Kapoor.
Yes, him.
Yes, it's an emergency!
How sure?
100%.
You've got to be shitting me.
Prove it to me.
For a start...
the solar panels have been cleaned.
They could have been cleaned by wind.
Back it up. Look at Rover 2.
According to the logs, Commander Lewis
took it out on Sol 17...
plugged it into the Hab to recharge.
It's been moved.
She could have forgotten
to log the move.
No, not likely.
Why don't we just ask Lewis?
Let's get on CAPCOM
and ask her directly right now.
No. No.
If Watney is really alive,
we don't want the Ares 3 crew to know.
How can you not tell them?
They have another 10 months
on their trip home.
Space travel is dangerous.
They need to be alert and undistracted.
But they already think he's dead.
And they'd be devastated to find out
they left him there alive.
I'm sorry,
but you have not thought this through.
What are we gonna say?
"Dear America...
"remember that astronaut
we killed and had a really nice funeral for?
"Turns out he's alive and we left him
on Mars. Our bad.
"Sincerely, NASA."
Do you realize the shitstorm
that is about to hit us?
How are we going to handle the public?
Legally, we have 24 hours
to release these pictures.
We release a statement with them.
We don't want people
working it out on their own.
Yes, sir.
But if my math is right, he's going to starve
to death long before we can help him.
Can you imagine
what he's going through up there?
He's 50 million miles away from home.
He thinks he's totally alone.
He thinks we gave up on him.
What does that do
to a man, psychologically?
What the hell is he thinking right now?
I'm definitely gonna die up here...
if I have to listen to any more
god-awful disco music.
My God, Commander Lewis, couldn't you
have packed anything from this century?
Turn the beat around
No, I am not gonna "turn the beat around."
I refuse to.
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?
What attempts have been made
to make contact with Mark Watney?
We're working on it.
Does he have enough supplies to survive?
We'll be looking into that.
What does this say about the agency?
Are you gonna resign?
No.
Director Sanders!
It's time to start thinking long term.
The next NASA mission is Ares 4...
and it's supposed to land
at Schiaparelli Crater...
3,200 kilometers away.
3,200 kilometers.
In four years, when the next Ares crew arrives,
I'll have to be there.
Which means I have to get to the crater.
Okay, so here's the rub.
I've got one working Rover designed
to go a max distance of 35 kilometers...
before the battery
has to be recharged at the Hab.
That's Problem A.
Problem B is this journey's gonna
take me roughly 50 days to complete.
So I gotta live for 50 days...
inside a Rover with marginal
life support the size of a small van.
So, in the face of overwhelming odds,
I'm left with only one option.
I'm gonna have to
science the shit out of this.
Okay, so, success.
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging Rover 1.
But if I use the heater...
I will burn through half my battery
every day.
If I do not use my heater, I will be...
slowly killed
by the laws of thermodynamics.
I would love to solve this problem
right now but unfortunately...
my balls are frozen.
I can't. I'm calling it. I'm calling it.
Good news, I may have a solution
to my heating problem.
Bad news, it involves me digging up
the Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator.
Now, if I remember my training correctly,
one of the lessons was titled...
"Don't Dig Up
the Big Box of Plutonium, Mark."
I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft,
but if they rupture around humans...
no more humans.
Which is why we buried it
when we arrived.
And planted that flag...
so we would never be stupid enough
to accidentally go near it again.
But as long as I don't break it...
I almost just said
"Everything will be fine" out loud.
Look, the point is,
I'm not cold anymore.
And sure, I could choose to think
about the fact that I'm warm...
because I have a decaying radioactive
isotope riding right behind me...
but right now, I got bigger problems
on my hands.
I have scoured every single data file
on Commander Lewis' personal drive.
This is officially
the least disco song she owns.
Lookin' for some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight
I want some hot stuff, baby, this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight
Hot stuff
I need hot stuff
I want some hot stuff
I need hot stuff
-Yeah.
-Where is Watney going?
We believe that
he's preparing for a journey.
He's been conducting
incremental tests...
taking the Rover 2 out for longer
and longer trips each time.
To what end? Why would he leave
the relative safety of the Hab?
Well, we think that he plans to travel
to the Ares 4 launch site...
in order to make contact with us,
but it would be a dangerous gamble.
But if we could talk to him,
we would tell him to stay put...
and to trust that we are doing everything
in our power to bring him home alive.
Thank you very much.
Don't say "Bring him home alive,"
Vincent.
You know what?
These interviews aren't easy.
So God forbid I try to say something
proactive and positive.
Annie.
No more Vincent on TV.
Copy that.
76 kilometers.
Am I reading that right?
Are you asking me?
I am.
Yes, sir.
Mark drove two hours
straightaway from the Hab...
did a short EVA
and then drove for another two.
We think the EVA
was to change batteries.
He didn't load up the oxygenator
or the water reclaimer?
Every 41 hours, there's a 17-minute gap.
It's just the way the orbits work...
so it's possible
that we missed something.
I want that gap down to four minutes.
I'm giving you total authority over
satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments.
Make it happen.
Okay.
Let's assume Miss Park
didn't miss anything.
So Mark's not going to Ares 4. Yet.
But he's smart enough to figure out
that's his only chance.
Bruce, what's the earliest we can
get a pre-supply there?
With the positions of Earth and Mars,
it'll take nine months.
It'll take six months
to build it in the first place.
Three months.
Three?
You're going to say it's impossible
and then I'm gonna make a speech...
about the blinding capabilities
of the JPL team...
and then you're going to do the math
in your head and say something like...
"The overtime alone
will be a nightmare."
The overtime alone will be a nightmare.
Get started.
I'll find you the money.
We need to tell the crew.
Mitch, we've discussed this.
No, you discussed this.
I'm the one who decides
what's best for the crew.
They deserve to know.
Once there's a real rescue plan,
we'll tell them.
Otherwise, it's moot.
Bruce has three months to get
the payload done.
That's all that matters right now.
We'll do our best.
Mark dies if you don't.
It's been 48 sols
since I planted the potatoes.
So now it's time to reap and re-sow.
They grew even better than I expected.
I now have 400 healthy potato plants.
I dug them up, being careful
to leave their plants alive.
The smaller ones I'll reseed,
the larger ones are my food supply.
All natural, organic,
Martian-grown potatoes.
You don't hear that every day, do you?
And by the way,
none of this matters at all...
if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA.
I know what I'm gonna do.
He's moving again.
Where the hell is he going?
He hasn't changed course for 13 days.
He's nowhere near the Ares 4.
Unless he's not taking a direct route.
He might be trying to avoid
some obstacle.
What obstacle?
It's Acidalia Planitia.
There's nothing out there except the...
What?
I need a map.
Yeah.
Hey, come on. What are you doing?
It's all right. It's all right.
Can I borrow this?
Okay, so where is the Hab location?
31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.
Okay.
Where's Watney?
There.
Okay.
Okay. I know where he's going.
I need to get on an airplane.
-Vincent, how are you?
-Good to see you.
Good flight?
Yeah.
It's in storage just around the corner.
Hey, Vincent, nice to see you again.
Nice to see you.
What are the chances Mark can
get it working again?
It's hard to say.
We lost contact in '97.
We think it was battery failure.
Though I'd like to point out it lasted
three times longer than expected in any...
Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce.
I just need to speak to everybody
that was here in '97.
They're already here. Guys.
I'd like to introduce Vincent Kapoor.
Director of Mars Missions for NASA.
This is our current team...
and our original project members.
-Is this the replica?
-This is her.
Okay. Let's see it.
Pathfinder.
Pathfinder.
Come on. Come on.
Holy shit. Okay.
"Broadcasting status.
"Listening for telemetry signal."
Okay. Signal acquired.
-All right.
-Okay.
Camera.
Incoming.
"Are you receiving me?"
"Yes. No."
Okay, point the camera at "yes."
32-minute round-trip
communications time.
All he can do
is ask yes or no questions...
and all we can do is point the camera.
This won't exactly be an Algonquin
Round Table of snappy repartee.
-Are you kidding me?
-Tim, Tim.
-Just point the camera.
-Roger that.
Pointing the camera.
Yes!
Yes!
So here's the rub.
Somehow we have to have complex
astrophysical engineering conversations...
using nothing but
a still-frame camera...
from 1996.
Luckily...
the camera does spin.
So I can make an alphabet.
It can't be our alphabet.
26 characters plus a question card
into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc.
That's way too narrow. I'd never know
what the camera was pointing at.
Hexadecimals.
Hexadecimals to the rescue.
I figured one of you guys
kept an ASCII table lying around.
And I was right.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you super-nerd Beth Johanssen.
Who also had copies of Zork II...
and Leather Goddesses of Phobos
on her personal laptop.
Seriously, Johanssen...
it's like the Smithsonian
of loneliness on there.
Not that I'm complaining.
Yes!
Who am I to talk about loneliness?
I know where he's going with this.
"F, O."
"7, W."
Vincent.
Vincent, wake up.
Now that we can have more
complicated conversations...
the smart people at NASA have sent me
instructions on how to hack the Rover...
so that it can talk to Pathfinder.
If I hack a tiny bit of code...
just 20 instructions in the Rover's
operating system...
NASA can link the Rover to Pathfinder's
broadcasting frequency...
and we're in business.
"Mark...
"this is Vincent Kapoor.
"We've been watching you since Sol 54.
"The whole world is rooting for you.
"Amazing job getting Pathfinder.
"We're working on rescue plans.
"Meantime, we're putting together
a supply mission...
"to keep you fed until Ares 4 arrives."
Okay.
Okay.
"Glad to hear it.
Really looking forward to not dying."
"How's the crew?"
"What did they say when they
found out I was alive?"
Guys, can we get some space please?
Me?
Yeah, you.
Give me a sec.
Just tell him.
"We haven't told the crew
you are alive yet.
"We need them to concentrate
on their mission."
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
Okay, he says,
"They don't know I'm alive?
"What the..." F-word.
F-word in gerund form.
F-word, again, "is wrong with you?"
"Mark, please watch your language.
"Everything you type is being broadcast
live all over the world."
Yeah?
Oh, my God.
Yes, sir. He is under a tremendous
amount of stress.
I understand. We're working on it.
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Problem is, Mark's right.
The longer we wait,
the worse it's gonna get.
We need to tell the crew.
You're bringing this up while
Vincent is in Pasadena...
so he can't argue the other side.
I shouldn't have to answer to Vincent.
Or anyone else.
It's time, Teddy.
Commander Lewis?
Go ahead.
Data dump is almost complete.
Copy that. On my way.
You're in a hurry.
Yeah.
My son turned three yesterday.
Should be pictures of the party.
Got a batch of personals.
Dispatching them to your laptops now.
I don't need to read Vogel's
weird German fetish emails.
They're telemetry updates.
Hey, whatever does it for you, man.
There's a video message.
It's addressed to the whole crew.
Play it. Come on, guys.
I wanna get in on that telemetry action.
Hi, hello. It's Mitch.
Mitch Henderson.
I have some news.
There's no subtle way to put this.
Mark Watney is still alive.
Oh, my God.
I know that's a surprise and I know
you will have a lot of questions.
But here are the basics.
He's alive and he's healthy.
We found out two months ago
and decided not to tell you.
-Two months?
-Oh, my God.
I was strongly against that decision.
We're telling you now because...
we finally have
communication with him...
and a viable rescue plan.
We'll give you a write-up of what happened,
a full write-up of everything.
But it's not your fault.
Mark stresses that
every time it comes up.
So... Yeah...
Take some time to absorb this.
And send all the questions you want.
We'll answer them.
All right. Henderson out.
Holy shit, he's alive.
I left him behind.
-No.
-No.
We all left together.
You were following orders.
I left him behind.
So now that NASA can talk to me,
they won't shut up.
They want constant updates
on every Hab system...
and they got a room full of people
trying to micromanage my crops.
Which is awesome.
Look, I don't mean to sound
arrogant or anything...
but I am the greatest botanist
on this planet, so...
One big bonus to this communication
with NASA again...
is the email.
I'm getting them again.
Big data dumps
like when I was on the Hermes.
I even got one from the president.
The coolest one, though,
the coolest one I got...
was from University of Chicago,
my alma mater.
They say that
once you grow crops somewhere...
you've officially colonized it.
So, technically...
I colonized Mars.
In your face, Neil Armstrong.
In other news, there's been a request...
for me to pose for a photograph
on my next transmission.
I'm trying to figure out whether
I should go with "High School Senior"...
or "coquettish ingnue."
But I'm not really sure how that's
gonna look with my spacesuit on.
Hey!
What is he doing?
I asked for a photo, and what,
he's The Fonz?
Just be grateful
we got you something, Annie.
I can't use this, Vincent,
and you know that.
I need a picture of his face.
I could tell him to take off his helmet...
but then he'd, you know, die, so...
We'll release the photo when we detail
the rescue operation.
I want to announce we're launching
some supplies to him next year...
during the Hohmann Transfer Window.
Bruce, your team's still on schedule?
It'll be tight, but we'll make it.
Nine-month travel time.
That puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868.
Did we get the botany team's analysis?
Yeah, they estimate Mark's crops
will last till Sol 912.
They grudgingly admit that
he's doing great work.
Grudgingly?
Yeah. Mark has a tendency to tell them
to have sex with themselves...
whenever they question
one of his decisions.
Get him in line, Vincent.
We can't afford any miscommunication.
I hate this margin.
912 Sols worth of food.
We get there on 868.
And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.
Suit breach detected.
Oxygen level critical.
Oxygen level, 10%.
Oxygen level, 5%.
Suit pressure, stable.
Pressure stable.
God! God, God, God, God!
Crops are dead.
Complete loss of pressure boiled off
most of the water.
Any bacteria that survived,
died in the subzero temperatures...
when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.
How long does he have?
He can still eat the potatoes he has,
he just can't grow any more...
so give him 200 sols.
Rations get him to what? Sol 409?
So with potatoes, 609.
So by Sol 868, he'll be long dead.
We're gonna have to launch
as soon as possible...
which changes our travel time.
Yeah, we're working on it.
Prelim estimates call
for a 414-day trip.
It's Sol 135 now.
We need 13 days to mount the boosters,
perform inspections...
which gives Bruce and his team...
47 days to make this probe.
I'll let you call Bruce,
give him the news.
Okay.
I'm gonna need a change of clothes.
"Dear Mark...
"Apparently NASA's letting us
talk to you now.
"And I drew the short straw.
"Sorry we left you behind on Mars.
"But we just don't like you.
"Also, it's a lot roomier
on the Hermes without you.
"We have to take turns doing your tasks.
"But, I mean, it's only botany.
"It's not real science."
Oh, Jesus.
"How's Mars?"
"Dear Martinez, Mars is fine.
"I accidentally blew up the Hab...
"but unfortunately, all of Commander Lewis'
disco music still survived."
"But unfortunately, all of Commander Lewis'
disco music still survived."
"Every day, I go outside and look
at the vast horizons."
"Every day, I go outside and look
at the vast horizons."
"Just because I can."
"Just because I can.
"Tell the others I said hello."
"Will do, buddy."
Pressure stable.
5, 10...
15, 20, 30, 35...
Rich.
Rich.
Wake up.
Sorry, but they're asking for
the probe courses.
What time is it?
It's 3:42.
Look, I know we're
coming at this backwards...
but we can't commit to a firm
launch date with this many unknowns.
It's all right.
All 25 models for launch will take
414 days to reach Mars.
They vary slightly in thrust duration...
and the fuel requirement
is nearly identical.
Not a good time to launch, is it?
Yeah, Earth and Mars
are really badly positioned.
Heck, it'd almost be easier if you...
Almost easier to what?
I need more coffee.
Are you all right?
It's fine.
Almost easier to what?
You do understand I'm your boss, right?
All right, let's ask the
very, very expensive question.
Is the probe going to be ready on time?
-We're behind.
-Give me a number.
15 days. 15 days and I can get it done.
All right, let's create 15 days.
13 days to mount the probe.
Can we reduce?
It actually only takes three days
to mount the probe.
And we can get that down to two, right?
I can get it down to two.
10 days are for tests and inspections.
How often do those inspections
reveal a problem?
Are you suggesting
we don't do the inspections?
Right now I'm asking how often
they reveal a problem.
One in 20.
But that's grounds for countdown halt.
We can't take that chance.
Anyone else know a safer way
to buy more time?
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's rations
four more days.
You're not gonna like it,
but that'll get us to 15.
-And we'll cancel the inspections.
-Teddy.
-Sir, if that ever got out...
-It's on me.
You got your two weeks.
Get it done.
So, now I have to hold out
until the probe gets here with more food.
You want to see what
minimal calorie count looks like?
Standard issue ration.
But instead of three of these
every one day...
I'm now eating one of these
every three days.
And now, they've asked me...
to do that.
The point is...
"stretch the rations four more days"...
is a real dick-punch.
I'm gonna dip this potato
in some crushed Vicodin.
And there's nobody who can stop me.
It has been seven days
since I ran out of ketchup.
Up. Up, up. Yeah.
Let's go up here.
Labels facing up.
This is the flight director.
Begin launch status check.
Roger that, Flight.
Beginning launch status check.
Do you believe in God, Vincent?
Yeah.
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,
my mother's a Baptist, so, yeah...
I believe in several.
We'll take all the help we can get.
Launch status check complete.
This is Flight.
We are go for launch.
Proceeding with the count.
10... 9...
8...
7... 6...
Main engines start.
4... 3...
2...
Liftoff.
Good thrust.
Performance is nominal.
The tail is giving good data.
She's rock solid at this point, Flight.
TVCs look good.
We're getting a little shimmy, Flight.
Say again?
We are getting a very large precession.
Are we good?
Flight, it's hitting the redline.
It's spinning on the long axis
around a 17-degree precession.
Launch, what's happening?
Force on Iris is 7 G's.
We've lost readings
on the probe, Flight.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
We've lost it, Flight.
SatCon?
No satellite acquisition of signal.
L.O.S.
L.O.S. here, too.
U.S. Destroyer Stockton reporting
debris falling from the sky.
Everyone in the LCC,
maintain your positions at your consoles.
GC, lock the doors.
"Commander Lewis...
"I may need you to do something for me.
"If I die, I need you to
check in on my parents.
"They'll wanna hear all about
our time here on Mars.
"I know that sucks.
"And it'll be hard
talking to a couple...
"about their dead son.
"It's a lot to ask.
"Which is why I'm asking you.
"I'm not giving up.
"We just need to prepare
for every outcome.
"Please tell them...
"Tell them I love what I do...
"and I'm really good at it.
"And that I'm dying...
"for something big...
"and beautiful...
"and greater than me.
"Tell them I said I can live with that.
"And tell them...
"thank you for being my mom and dad."
We substituted protein cubes
for the standard rations.
The thrust of the launch combined with
the simultaneous lateral vibration...
liquefied the cubes
and created an unbalanced load.
Vincent, why wasn't this addressed
in the inspections phase?
In order to make our launch window,
we were forced to accelerate our schedule.
Their astronaut is going to die.
Of course there are other ways...
...the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,
and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit.
Why hasn't NASA approached us?
They don't know.
Our booster technology is classified.
So if we do nothing...
The world would never know we could have helped.
Then, for the sake of argument, let's say we
decide to help them...
We'd be giving up a booster and effectively
cancelling Taiyang Shen.
We need to keep this among scientists,
a co-operation between space agencies.
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.
Yes!
All right.
Thanks to my uncle Tommy in China,
we get another chance at this.
Now, we finished the Iris probe in 62 days.
We are now gonna attempt
to finish it in 28.
We can jettison any kind of landing system.
We're only sending rations.
We can crash-land on Mars.
You should hang up the phone.
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-My name is Rich Purnell.
I work in Astrodynamics, and you should
hang up the phone right now.
All right, all right.
I'm gonna call you back.
I know how to save Mark Watney.
Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.
I've got a better way.
Astrodynamics?
Yeah.
What the hell is "Project Elrond"?
I had to make something up.
But "Elrond"?
Because it's a secret meeting.
How do you know that?
Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting"?
The Council of Elrond.
It's from Lord of the Rings.
Lord of the Rings.
It's the meeting where
they decide to destroy the One Ring.
If we're gonna call something
"Project Elrond"...
I would like my code name
to be "Glorfindel."
Okay, I hate every one of you.
What, Teddy doesn't even
know about this yet?
I'm sorry, who are you?
This is Rich Purnell, Astrodynamics.
Tell them what you just told me.
I can get the Hermes back to Mars
by Sol 561.
How?
Could you stand right there
for me, please?
Thanks.
Right there. Great.
And could you stand right there?
Right there.
Okay, let's pretend that this stapler
is the Hermes...
and you are...
I'm sorry, what's your name again?
Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA.
Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.
And right now, the Hermes
is headed towards you...
starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.
But instead, what I'm proposing is...
we start accelerating immediately
to preserve velocity and gain even more.
We don't intercept with Earth at all...
but we come close enough to get
a gravity assist and adjust course.
While we're doing that...
we resupply with the probe...
The Taiyang Shen.
...pick up whatever provisions we need...
and now we're accelerating towards Mars.
You're Mars.
Now, we're going too fast
at this point to fall into orbit...
but we can do a flyby.
What good is a flyby if we can't get
Watney off the surface?
Watney would intercept using the MAV.
And then we just head home.
I've done the math. It checks out.
-Rich.
-Yes, sir.
Get out.
All right.
-Is he right?
-Yeah.
Bruce, what do you think?
Well, if Vincent says so.
We need to use the Taiyang Shen?
What am I missing?
Why is that important?
Because we can only do one.
Send Watney enough food
to last till Ares 4...
or send Hermes back
to get him right now.
Both plans require the Taiyang Shen,
so we have to choose.
But what about the Hermes crew?
We'd be asking them to add
533 extra days to their mission.
Yeah. They wouldn't hesitate,
not for a second.
Can the Hermes function for 533 days
beyond the scheduled mission end?
It should.
Built to last the full Ares mission...
so technically, it's only halfway
through its lifespan.
But if something goes wrong...
Then we lose the crew.
So what? We either have a high chance
of killing one person...
or a low chance of killing six people.
How do we make that decision?
We don't have to make it, Bruce.
He does.
Yeah, well, bullshit.
It should be Commander Lewis' call.
We still have a chance to bring
five astronauts home safe and sound.
I'm not risking their lives.
Let them make that decision.
Mitch, we're going with option one.
You goddamn coward.
-Johanssen?
-Yeah.
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?
Yeah, go ahead.
-Where are you?
-The gym.
What's up?
I just got an email from my wife
and the subject line says, "Our children."
My computer won't open the attachment.
Okay.
Let's take a look.
Let's see.
This isn't a JPEG.
It's a plain ASCII text file.
I don't really know
what we're looking at.
Does that make any sense to you?
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."
It's a course maneuver for the Hermes.
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept, 211 days later.
Would it work?
We ran the numbers. They check out.
It's a brilliant course.
So why all the cloak and dagger?
Because it goes directly against
NASA's decision.
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,
they'd have to send the supply ship or we die.
We have the opportunity to force their hand.
So, are we gonna do it?
If it was up to me,
we'd already be on our way.
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.
Not this time.
This is something NASA
expressly rejected.
We're talking about mutiny here,
which is not a word that I take lightly.
So we do this together or not at all.
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.
If we mess up the supply rendezvous,
we die.
If we mess up the Earth gravity assist,
we die.
If we do everything perfectly...
we add 533 days to our mission.
533 more days before we see
our families again.
533 days of unplanned space travel...
where anything could go wrong.
If it's mission critical, we die.
Sign me up.
All right, cowboy, slow down.
You and I, we're military.
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.
-Yeah, there's that.
-And for the rest of you guys...
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.
Good. So, if we go for it,
how would it work?
I plot the course and execute it.
Remote override.
They could take over the Hermes
from Mission Control.
Can you disable it?
Hermes has four redundant
flight computers...
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.
We can't shut down the comms because
we'd lose telemetry and guidance.
And we can't shut down the computers
because we need to run the ship.
I'd have to disable remote override
on each system.
It's part of the OS,
I'd have to jump over the code.
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?
I can do it.
Great.
Well, it has to be unanimous.
If we do this,
it'll be over 900 days of space.
That's more than enough space
for one life...
so, yes.
I vote yes.
Let's go get him.
Johanssen?
Yes.
Yeah!
Got an unscheduled status update
from Hermes.
Roger. Read it out.
Message reads,
"Houston, please be advised.
"Rich Purnell
is a steely-eyed missile man."
What?
Flight, Guidance.
Hermes is off-course.
CAPCOM, advise Hermes they're drifting.
Guidance, get a correction ready.
Negative, Flight, it's not drift.
They've adjusted course.
What the hell?
Telemetry, any chance
this is instrumentation failure?
Negative, Flight.
Guidance, work at how long they can stay
on this course before it's irreversible.
Working on that now, Flight.
Hey. Who's Rich Purnell?
I dunno.
Will somebody find out
who the hell Rich Purnell is?
Annie will go before the media
this morning...
and inform them of NASA's decision
to reroute the Hermes to Mars.
Sounds like a smart move.
Considering the circumstances.
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.
Crew made the decision on their own.
You may have killed them, Mitch.
We're fighting the same war.
Every time something goes wrong,
the world forgets why we fly.
I'm trying to keep us airborne.
It's bigger than one person.
No.
It's not.
When this is over,
I'll expect your resignation.
I understand.
Bring our astronauts home.
Every Ares mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.
So NASA decided a long time ago
it's a lot easier...
to send some of the stuff beforehand
rather than bring it with us.
So, as a result, the MAV for Ares 4...
is already there at the
Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.
So the plan is for me to use that
to go into orbit...
just as the Hermes is passing...
and I guess they catch me?
In space.
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out...
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...
the oxygenator, the water reclaimer,
the atmospheric regulator...
bring that all with me.
And luckily, I have the greatest minds
on Planet Earth...
really, all of the brainpower
on the entire planet...
helping me with this endeavor.
And so far they've come up with...
"Hey, why don't you drill holes
on the roof of your Rover...
"and hit it as hard as you can
with a rock?"
We're gonna get there.
533 days longer?
And you said yes to this?
He would have done the same for me.
You know that.
Cheese. You do "cheese"?
Cheese.
He didn't do "cheese."
Did he do "cheese"?
Hey, baby.
Hey.
I got something for you.
Found it in the flea market.
Original pressing.
No!
Not a scratch.
I love it.
All due respect to your CNSA protocol...
but we haven't done things that way...
since Apollo 9.
Did he get that?
I've been thinking about laws on Mars.
There's an international treaty
saying no country can lay claim...
to anything that's not on Earth.
And by another treaty, if you're not
in any country's territory...
maritime law applies.
So Mars is international waters.
Now, NASA is an American
non-military organization.
It owns the Hab.
But the second I walk outside,
I'm in international waters.
So here's the cool part.
I'm about to leave for
the Schiaparelli Crater...
where I'm gonna commandeer
the Ares 4 lander.
Nobody explicitly gave me
permission to do this...
and they can't
until I'm on board the Ares 4.
So that means I'm gonna be
taking a craft over...
in international waters
without permission.
Which, by definition, makes me a pirate.
Mark Watney, Space Pirate.
A Space Pirate.
Everywhere I go, I'm the first.
It's a strange feeling.
Step outside the Rover...
first guy to be there.
Climb that hill, first guy to do that.
Four and a half billion years...
nobody here.
And now, me.
I'm the first person to be alone
on an entire planet.
How's he doing?
So far, so good.
He's sticking to schedule.
Drives for four hours before noon...
lays the solar panels,
waits 13 hours for them to recharge...
and sleeps somewhere in there
and then starts again.
How's he doing?
He asked us to call him
Captain Blondebeard.
Well, technically,
Mars would be under maritime...
Yeah, I know. He explained it to us.
Where is he?
-There.
-Okay.
Here.
Okay.
Okay, I'm gonna start by stating for the record
that you're not gonna like this.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, the problem is the intercept velocity.
The Hermes, well...
It can't enter Mars' orbit.
Otherwise, they'll never have enough
fuel to make it home.
The MAV, that was only designed
to get to low Mars orbit.
So in order for Mark to escape
Mars' gravity entirely...
and to intercept the Hermes...
-He has to be going fast.
-Exactly.
Which means we need to make
the MAV lighter.
A lot lighter. 5,000 kilograms lighter.
You can do that, right?
There's some gimmes right off the bat.
The design presumes 500 kilograms
of Martian soil and samples.
Obviously we won't do that.
And there's just one passenger
instead of six.
With suits and gear, that's another 500?
Ditch the life support, don't need it.
And we'll get Mark to wear
his EVA suit the whole trip.
Wait a second. If he's in his EVA suit,
how is he gonna operate the controls?
Well, he won't.
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the Hermes.
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.
But I am excited about the opportunities
that affords.
If we go remote, we can lose the control panels,
the secondary and tertiary comm systems.
Wait a second.
You want a remote-controlled ascent
with no backup comms?
He's not even got to
the bad stuff yet, Vincent.
Let's skip to the bad stuff!
We need to remove the nose airlock,
the windows, and Hull Panel 19.
You want to take
the front of the ship off?
Sure.
The nose airlock alone is 400 kilograms.
You want to send a man into space
without the front of his ship?
Well, no.
We're gonna have him cover it
with Hab canvas.
Look, the hull's mostly there
to keep the air in.
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,
you don't need a lot of streamlining.
By the time the ship's going fast enough
for air resistance to matter...
it'll be high enough that
there's practically no air.
You wanna send him into space
under a tarp.
Yes.
Can I go on?
No.
You think he means it like...
"Are you kidding me?"
You know?
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"
I think it might be the second one.
Really?
Could be the first way.
"Are you kidding me?"
Yeah, it could be the first way.
I know what they're doing.
I know exactly what they're doing.
They just keep repeating...
"Go faster than any man
in the history of space travel."
Like that's a good thing.
Like it'll distract me from
how insane their plan is.
Yeah, I get to go faster than any man
in the history of space travel...
because you are launching me
in a convertible.
Actually it's worse than that because
I won't even be able to control the thing.
And by the way, physicists,
when describing things like acceleration...
do not use the word "fast."
So they're only doing that in the hopes
that I won't raise any objections...
to this lunacy.
Because I like the way "fastest man
in the history of space travel" sounds.
I do like the way it sounds.
I mean, I like it a lot.
I'm not gonna tell them that.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Come on.
Beck, Vogel, I want you guys in Airlock 2
with the outer door open...
-before the MAV even launches.
-Okay.
Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysops the ascent.
Once we hit intercept,
it's Beck's job to go get Watney.
We're ready.
What's the intercept plan?
We finished attaching the tethers
into one long line.
It's 214 meters long.
And I'll have the MMU,
so moving around should be easy.
How fast a relative velocity
can you handle?
I can grab the MAV
at 5 meters per second.
10 is like jumping onto a moving train.
So any more than that and I might miss.
Well, we may have some leeway.
The launch takes 12 minutes.
And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.
Once Mark's engine shuts off...
we'll know our intercept point
and velocity.
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.
Everything goes well,
you pull them on board with the tether.
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.
Yep.
Okay.
Let's go get our boy.
There's a mood of tension and anxiety
here, outside Johnson Space Center.
As you can see,
many people have gathered here...
to see whether or not the mission
to retrieve Mark Watney will be a success.
They've had some contact with him,
but it hasn't been very much.
We have to remind our viewers
that we're watching this as it unfolds.
So we'll try and keep you up-to-date
as to what exactly is going on.
Let's listen in to NASA
making contact with Mark Watney.
Let's listen in.
If something goes wrong,
what can Mission Control do?
Not a damn thing.
It's all happening
12 light-minutes away...
which means it takes 24 minutes for them
to get the answer to any question they ask.
The whole launch is 12 minutes...
so they're on their own.
...just how long Mark has been
completely alone on Mars.
We're talking to a psychology
expert later to discuss...
Fuel pressure, green.
Engine alignment, perfect.
Communications, five by five.
We are ready
for pre-flight checklist, Commander.
Mission Control, this is Hermes actual.
We will proceed on schedule.
We are T-minus 2 minutes, 10 seconds
to launch, by the mark.
About two minutes, Watney.
How you doing down there?
I'm good.
I'm anxious to get up to you.
Thanks for coming back for me.
Well, we're on it.
Remember, you'll be pulling some serious G's,
so it's okay to pass out.
You're in Martinez's hands now.
Well, tell that asshole no barrel rolls.
Copy that, MAV.
CAPCOM.
Go.
Remote command.
Go.
Recovery.
Go.
Secondary recovery.
Go.
Pilot.
Go.
Pilot.
Go.
Copy. We're go.
Mission Control, we are go for launch.
T-minus ten...
-nine...
-Main engine start.
eight...
seven...
Mooring clamps released.
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.
I'll see you in a few, Commander.
four...
three...
two...
one.
Velocity, 741 meters per second.
Altitude, 1,350 meters.
That's too low.
It's fighting me.
Watney, do you read?
Booster separation complete.
Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1,843.
He's well below target altitude.
How far below?
Checking.
Watney.
Do you read?
He's probably passed out.
He pulled 12 G's on the ascent.
Give him a few minutes.
Copy that.
Main shutdown in three...
two, one...
shutdown.
Back to automatic guidance.
Shutdown confirmed.
Fuel reserves depleted.
Watney?
Do you read?
It seems there's some sort of problem
with the transmission.
I have interval pings.
Intercept velocity will be
11 meters per second.
I can make that work.
Distance at intercept will be...
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.
68 kilometers?
Did she just say 68 kilometers?
Come on, guys, keep it together.
Work the problem.
Johanssen, time to intercept?
39 minutes, 12 seconds.
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters
in the same direction?
Well, it depends how much fuel
you wanna save...
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.
How much do you need?
I can get by with about 20%
of what we have left.
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...
that will bring the intercept range to zero.
Do it.
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...
but the intercept velocity will be
42 meters per second.
And that's way too fast.
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out
how to slow down.
Martinez, burn the jets.
Copy that.
MAV to Hermes.
Watney?
Affirmative.
What's your status?
My chest hurts.
I broke my ribs.
How are you?
We're working on getting to you.
There was a complication during launch.
Copy that.
How bad is it?
We've corrected the intercept range,
but we've got a problem with intercept velocity.
How big a problem?
42 meters a second.
Well...
shit.
Commander, I have an idea.
Go ahead, Mark.
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...
and poke a hole in the glove
of my EVA suit...
I could use the escaping air
as a thruster...
and fly towards you.
It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.
I can't see you having any control
if you did that.
You'd be eyeballing the intercept
using a thrust vector you can barely control.
Yes, those are all very good points.
But consider this.
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.
Commander...
let's go Iron Man.
This is unexpected LOS.
Communication lost. Stand by.
Maybe it's not the worst idea.
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.
Not what he said.
Using atmosphere as thrust.
What happens if we blow the VAL?
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?
It'll give us a good kick.
But also blow the nose off the ship.
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.
Everywhere else would go vacuo.
Vogel.
Go ahead, Commander.
I need you to come inside
and make a... bomb.
Again, Commander?
You're a chemist. Can you make a bomb
with what you have on board?
Probably.
But I feel obliged to mention that
setting off an explosive device...
in a spacecraft
is a terrible, terrible idea.
Hang on.
You guys making a bomb without me?
Copy that. Can you do it?
Ja.
Houston, be advised.
We are going to deliberately breach
the VAL to produce a reverse thrust.
Beck, leave your suit on.
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.
We'll open the outer door.
I need you to place the charge
on the inner door.
Climb back to Airlock 2 along the hull.
Copy. I'm on my way.
I'm in, Commander.
Copy that.
Vogel, where are you?
I'm in the kitchen.
Okay.
Commander...
I can't let you go through with this.
I am prepared to cut the suit.
Absolutely not.
See, the thing is, I'm selfish.
I want all the memorials back home
to be about me.
Just me.
I should have left this guy on Mars.
Hey.
-Sugar?
-Yeah.
Can you hold this?
Liquid oxygen...
and some stain remover
that contains ammonia.
This thing here is five times stronger
than a stick of dynamite.
How do we activate it?
Can you connect this to
one of our lighting panels?
Careful.
Open Airlock 1.
I'm on the way to Beck.
Let's just hope
this is a good idea, guys.
It is.
Open A1.
-Hi.
-Hey.
You got it?
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.
Hey.
Be careful out there.
In space.
Don't tell anyone I did that.
Bomb set.
Leaving Airlock 1.
Guys, I'm running the numbers,
and even with optimal VAL blow...
we're gonna be off on our angle.
What's the intercept distance?
Johanssen?
260 meters, approximate.
That's too far.
Commander?
Martinez, close the door.
Open D3.
And leave it open.
Open B2.
Johanssen...
time to VAL blow after initiate?
15 seconds.
We sure know how to cut it close.
Commander?
Distance is too far. I'm going out.
I can do this.
It's not a debate.
I'm not risking another crew member.
Beck's returned.
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.
Ten seconds.
Strap in.
Five, four...
three...
-Brace for deceleration.
-two...
one.
Activating Panel 41.
Bridge seal holding.
What's the damage?
Worry about that later.
What's the relative velocity?
12 meters per second.
Copy.
Hook me up.
Done.
I have visual on the MAV.
What's the intercept range?
I'm checking.
312 meters.
Did you say 312?
Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.
I can't get to you, Mark.
You're too far.
I'm not gonna make it.
I know.
Beck, unhook me. I'm going after him.
Commander, I got this.
Mark, report.
On my way, Commander.
Damn it.
Johanssen, what's my relative velocity to Mark?
5.2 meters per second.
Copy. Adjusting course.
3.1 meters per second.
Distance to target, 24 meters.
11 meters to target.
Six meters.
Hold on, Mark.
I got him.
I got him.
I got him.
Way to go, Iron Man.
Beck, pull us in.
It's good to see you.
You...
have terrible taste in music.
Houston, this is Hermes actual.
We got him.
Watney is secure.
Contact in outer space with Mark Watney.
After a very long time, they have done
what many people thought was impossible.
Mission confirmation:
Mark Watney has been successfully rescued.
Grab a hold of him.
Hey, handsome!
Beck, close the hatch.
Hey, guys!
Houston, six crew safely aboard.
This is huge moment for this nation,
for the world...
and indeed,
for international space travel.
I can't believe anything you do works.
Hey!
Oh, God.
I can't believe it.
There's a little smell
going on over there, bud.
I know. I haven't had a shower
in a year and a half.
Don't make me laugh, I have broken ribs.
Hey, there.
-Morning, sir.
-It's an honor, sir.
Sir.
-Sir.
-Sir.
Morning, sir.
Welcome to the
Astronaut Candidate Program.
Now pay attention,
because this could save your life.
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.
Let me get a few things
out of the way, right off the bat.
Yes, I did in fact survive on
a deserted planet by farming in my own shit.
Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds.
So let's not talk about that ever again.
The other question I get
most frequently is...
"When I was up there,
stranded by myself...
"did I think I was going to die?"
Yes, absolutely.
And that's what you need to know going in
because it's going to happen to you.
This is space. It does not cooperate.
At some point, everything is
going to go south on you.
Everything is going to go south and
you're going to say, "This is it.
"This is how I end."
Now, you can either accept that...
or you can get to work.
That's all it is.
You just begin.
You do the math.
You solve one problem...
then you solve the next one.
And then the next.
And if you solve enough problems,
you get to come home.
All right, questions?
Once Mission Control completes
their pre-flight checks...
we'll begin launch procedures.
The Ares 5 team
will rendezvous with the Hermes...
approximately 48 minutes after launch.
From there, they will have 414 days
of space travel ahead of them.
Have the goals changed
from the previous mission...
to the Ares 5 program?
And what do you hope to achieve
this time around?
Well, no. The goals have always been
the same for the Ares program.
This time, of course, we hope to bring
all the astronauts back at the same time.
-Flight, Guidance check complete.
-Copy, Guidance.
This is Flight.
We are go for launch, on schedule.
Final aerosurface checks are complete...
as everything remains a go
for the launch of the Ares 5.
20 seconds.
Proceeding with the count.
T-minus 10... 9...
Main engine start.
7... 6... 5... 4...
three... two... one.
And liftoff.
As the crew of the Ares 5...
begin the next chapter
of American space exploration.
Pressures look good.
Wow. Good shot.
There you have it. Five years after
the rescue of astronaut Mark Watney...
an Ares 5 is on its way to Mars.

According to all known laws
of aviation,
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Ooming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
- Barry?
- Adam?
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school,
three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
You did come back different.
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!
- Bee-men.
- Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...
...9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies.
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!
Will we pick ourjob today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco
and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.
Our top-secret formula
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...
Honey!
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off
in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Oheck it out.
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like
outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Oouple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?
- Out there.
- Oh, no!
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd
that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
- Thank you.
- OK.
You got a rain advisory today,
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!
All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Oool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?
Oopy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Ohemical-y.
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Oandy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
- Guys!
- This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Ooming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
- Do something!
- I'm driving!
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Oan't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close
the window please?
Oheck out my new rsum.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.
You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...
Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that...
...kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming.
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have
less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.
Put that on your rsum brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.
I gotta say something.
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble.
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!
No. Yes. No.
Do it. I can't.
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry.
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.
But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,
but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you...
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird.
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey. " You pick it up.
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway...
Oan I...
...get you something?
- Like what?
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?"
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
- You do?
- Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look...
There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you?
Oan I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
- Thanks!
- Yeah.
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.
Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you
so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.
You had your "experience. " Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.
- Well...
- Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.
I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life!
And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
- Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:
Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that
down to a science.
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,
Ray Liotta Private Select?
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.
You don't have
enough food of your own?
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!
And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!
Hey, Hector.
- You almost done?
- Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well, I guess I'll go home now
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.
You're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!
You're too late! It's ours now!
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!
Where is the honey coming from?
Tell me where!
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
Orazy person!
What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
- And you?
- He really is dead.
All right.
Uh-oh!
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
How much do you people need to see?!
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.
But don't kill no more bugs!
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!
- You hear something?
- Like what?
Like tiny screaming.
Turn off the radio.
Whassup, bee boy?
Hey, Blood.
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.
Wow!
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.
I mean, that honey's ours.
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.
It's a close community.
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.
What is this place?
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.
They are pinheads!
Pinhead.
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.
The Thomas 3000!
Smoker?
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.
They make the honey,
and we make the money.
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?
Oh, my!
What's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!
That's a drag queen!
What is this?
Oh, no!
There's hundreds of them!
Bee honey.
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.
Do these look like rumors?
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.
How did you get mixed up in this?
He's been talking to humans.
- What?
- Talking to humans?!
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!
Make out? Barry!
We do not.
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?
The bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
Sting them where it really hurts.
In the face! The eye!
- That would hurt.
- No.
Up the nose? That's a killer.
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.
No more bee beards!
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.
Weather with Storm Stinger.
Sports with Buzz Larvi.
And Jeanette Ohung.
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.
How old are you?
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,
which will be the trial
of the bee century.
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.
It's a common name. Next week...
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...
Next week...
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!
I'm helping him sue the human race.
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.
This is Ken.
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
Why does he talk again?
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.
But it's our yogurt night!
Bye-bye.
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.
So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities.
And it takes my mind off the shop.
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.
Those are great, if you're three.
And artificial flowers.
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
Bees must hate those fake things!
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.
You sure you want to go through with it?
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
It's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.
Well, if it isn't the bee team.
You boys work on this?
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.
All right. Oase number 4475,
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. The Honey Industry
is now in session.
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?
A privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
my grandmother was a simple woman.
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,
just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm
for the elastic in my britches!
Talking bee!
How do we know this isn't some sort of
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?
They could be using laser beams!
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,
he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room
who think they can take it from us
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have
but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!
Oall your first witness.
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.
- No.
- No.
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
They're very lovable creatures.
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
You mean like this?
Bears kill bees!
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!
OK, that's enough. Take him away.
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?
No, I haven't.
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.
Oh, please.
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.
Thank you. Thank you.
I see from your rsum
that you're devilishly handsome
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!
Order! Order, I say!
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.
I think the jury's on our side.
Are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
To a great team!
Well, hello.
- Ken!
- Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.
Ken, Barry was looking at your rsum,
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.
You think I don't see what you're doing?
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.
Do we?
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.
I'm going to drain the old stinger.
Yeah, you do that.
Look at that.
You know, I've just about had it
with your little mind games.
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.
A lot of ads.
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!
I think something stinks in here!
I love the smell of flowers.
How do you like the smell of flames?!
Not as much.
Water bug! Not taking sides!
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!
I've got issues!
Well, well, well, a royal flush!
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?
Surf's up, dude!
Poo water!
That bowl is gnarly.
Except for those dirty yellow rings!
Kenneth! What are you doing?!
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!
We need to talk!
He's just a little bee!
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!
Goodbye, Ken.
And for your information,
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!
I'm sorry about all that.
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.
Are you OK for the trial?
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...
Yeah.
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.
What exactly is your relationship
to that woman?
We're friends.
- Good friends?
- Yes.
How good? Do you live together?
Wait a minute...
Are you her little...
...bedbug?
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!
Hold me back!
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?
He's denouncing bees!
Don't y'all date your cousins?
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!
Oh, I'm hit!
Oh, lordy, I am hit!
Order! Order!
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison
from my heaving buttocks?
I will have order in this court. Order!
Order, please!
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race
took a pointed turn against the bees
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.
I...
I blew the whole case, didn't I?
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.
What was it like to sting someone?
I can't explain it. It was all...
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!
All right.
You think it was all a trap?
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.
What will the humans do to us
if they win?
I don't know.
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!
Oh, my.
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?
- Why?
- The smoke.
Bees don't smoke.
Right. Bees don't smoke.
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.
That's it! That's our case!
It is? It's not over?
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.
And assuming you've done step 29
correctly, you're ready for the tub.
Mr. Flayman.
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!
Where is the rest of your team?
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.
I actually heard a funny story about...
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.
But you can't! We have a terrific case.
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?
Show me the smoking gun!
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?
Here is your smoking gun.
What is that?
It's a bee smoker!
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.
Look at what has happened
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"
Is this what nature intended for us?
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines
and man-made wooden slat work camps?
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
Free the bees!
Free the bees! Free the bees!
The court finds in favor of the bees!
Vanessa, we won!
I knew you could do it! High-five!
Sorry.
I'm OK! You know what this means?
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.
You'll regret this.
Barry, how much honey is out there?
All right. One at a time.
Barry, who are you wearing?
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.
Oongratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,
every last drop.
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.
Wait for my signal.
Take him out.
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...
But it's just a prance-about stage name!
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.
Oan't breathe.
Bring it in, boys!
Hold it right there! Good.
Tap it.
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.
Shut down honey production!
Stop making honey!
Turn your key, sir!
What do we do now?
Oannonball!
We're shutting honey production!
Mission abort.
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.
Oh, yeah?
What's going on? Where is everybody?
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.
I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.
At least we got our honey back.
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.
And now...
Now I can't.
I don't understand
why they're not happy.
I thought their lives would be better!
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?
- What did you want to show me?
- This.
What happened here?
That is not the half of it.
Oh, no. Oh, my.
They're all wilting.
Doesn't look very good, does it?
No.
And whose fault do you think that is?
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.
Bees?
Specifically, me.
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.
It's notjust flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.
That's our whole SAT test right there.
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.
And then, of course...
The human species?
So if there's no more pollination,
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?
I know this is also partly my fault.
How about a suicide pact?
How do we do it?
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- Thatjust kills you twice.
Right, right.
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.
I had to open my mouth and talk.
Vanessa?
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.
I know. Me neither.
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?
Roses!
Vanessa!
Roses?!
Barry?
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.
Flowers, bees, pollen!
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.
Maybe not.
Oould you ask him to slow down?
Oould you slow down?
Barry!
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.
Yes, it kind of is.
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.
Actually, it's completely closed down.
I thought maybe you were remodeling.
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.
I don't want to hear it!
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.
- Bees.
- Park.
- Pollen!
- Flowers.
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, Oalifornia.
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.
Security will be tight.
I have an idea.
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.
Official floral business. It's real.
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.
Thank you. It was a gift.
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.
How about The Princess and the Pea?
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!
Yes, I got it.
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?
It goes under the mattresses.
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!
Let's see what this baby'll do.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...
...without arousing suspicion.
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.
Stop! Security.
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?
Would you remove your shoes?
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.
Oan you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!
I think this is gonna work.
It's got to work.
Attention, passengers,
this is Oaptain Scott.
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.
Be careful.
Oan I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.
Oaptain, I'm in a real situation.
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.
Bee!
Don't freak out! My entire species...
What are you doing?
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?
Don't move.
Oh, Barry.
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?
And please hurry!
What happened here?
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!
No one's flying the plane!
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.
Where's the pilot?
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?
As a matter of fact, there is.
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.
It's got giant wings, huge engines.
I can't fly a plane.
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.
How hard could it be?
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...
That's Barry!
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers
and an incapacitated flight crew.
Flowers?!
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls
with absolutely no flight experience.
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.
They've done enough damage.
But isn't he your only hope?
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.
Their wings are too small...
Haven't we heard this a million times?
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense. "
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.
- Stand by.
- We're going live.
The way we work may be a mystery to you.
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.
But let me tell you about a small job.
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.
We get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!
Left, right, down, hover.
- Hover?
- Forget hover.
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!
Barry, what happened?!
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!
Move out!
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!
Don't have to yell.
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!
I can't do this!
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!
You snap out of it.
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!
- Hold it!
- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.
How is the plane flying?
I don't know.
Hello?
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?
The Pollen Jocks!
They do get behind a fellow.
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.
Where? I can't see anything. Oan you?
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.
Oome on. You got to think bee, Barry.
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.
Bring the nose down.
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.
Out the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?
Affirmative!
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.
Land on that flower!
Ready? Full reverse!
Spin it around!
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower
made of millions of bees!
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.
Rotate around it.
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!
Just drop it. Be a part of it.
Aim for the center!
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!
Oome on, already.
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.
Listen, everyone!
This runway is covered
with the last pollen
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.
That means this is our last chance.
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?
Are we going to be bees, orjust
Museum of Natural History keychains?
We're bees!
Keychain!
Then follow me! Except Keychain.
Hold on, Barry. Here.
You've earned this.
Yeah!
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.
Oh, yeah.
That's our Barry.
Mom! The bees are back!
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Oan I help who's next?
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!
I had no idea.
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.
Sorry I'm late.
He's a lawyer too?
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.
Have a great afternoon!
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Oan I help who's next?
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.
Thank you, Barry!
That bee is living my life!
Let it go, Kenny.
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.
- Thinking bee!
- Me?
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Oan we stop here?
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.

1
My generation, born in a state of war.
Giant monsters attack our world.
We call it Kaiju.
They enter through a hole,
a bridge to another dimension.
At the bottom of the Pacific Ocean.
Sent by another race from another world.
Precursor.
To fight it we
make our own monster ..
Jaeger.
The giant robot, so big that it takes two pilots to control it.
My father is one of them.
He separated himself,
to save the others.
I ..
I'm not my father.
It's been 10 years since we won the war.
And close the hole.
Most of this world has been rebuilt.
But some cities can not do it.
And the world is still picking up the pieces.
Some of us live
better on broken boats.
And living in a half-lived mansion,
much better than a bad apartment.
And to live here you have to be creative.
You have to cheat others
to get breakfast.
And a new pastry.
And for the fraud, you
know how to do it?
You create a different value on the stuff.
The Pacific Defense Corps
usually look the other way.
So long as you do not break the law.
For example ..
Jaeger Metal Disposal Commission.
Santa Monica, California
Big risk means, great results.
And no one gets more
money than taking Jaeger technology.
Some crazy people try to
to build their own Jaeger.
But they need us to make it.
So .. if you can steal in place
that no one else can steal ..
You can live like a king.
Are you sure the item is here?
Dad, redistribute everything
here when dismissed ..
Sometimes they are incorrect
sending Plasma Capacitors.
And the price is very expensive
if you can pick it up.
You better hope so.
Okay.
Take it easy, do not be too eager.
I'm here just looking at the possibilities.
And I do not want any
to spoil it, and steal from me.
In my own backyard.
Now I see you actually.
Circle of life.
Are we okay?
If you manage to get it, yes.
Good.
Let's get rich.
Good.
Plasma Capacitor does not exist.
Where is it?
Hey, Mack, there's a bit of a problem.
Here it says it should be there.
But you know what, let me finish this.
Somebody please kill this guy for me.
Complete target.
No, no. Calm down.
You guys, wait, wait ..
It's upstairs, we can find it, come on.
- Come on.
- Jake!
- Jake.
- Hey, wait!
Capture him!
Come on, fast, fast!
Slowly.
Capture him!
Come on, hey!
Let's go down there! Hurry up.
Jake.
Good effort.
Yes.
Jake.
We're fine.
- (WARNING DO NOT STAND IN THE DOOR)
- Hey, do not run.
Goal ..
Hey!
Return here!
Goals stopped.
The Kaiju war is over!
Shao Company Takes Technology Transfer
How old are you?
Enough ages to beat you.
Wait a minute, backwards, backwards.
You made this Jaeger alone?
What do you think?
I think I can sell it
for a very high price.
Scrapper is not a toy.
And he is not for sale.
The person holding the pipe says he can be sold.
So listen ..
You brought them here?
That's not possible.
Hey!
Oh, whatever!
Come on.
This works!
Okay.
Wow, wow ..
Hey, get out!
What are you doing?
No, no, no.
- Quick.
- Stop.
Do not do that. Hey!
What are you doing?
- Where is the other one?
- What else?
The other pilot, Jaeger takes 2 pilots.
Scrapper has only one main nervous system.
Well, then you're out,
let me be the pilot.
Get out!
Fuck with it!
Run, smart boy.
You're gonna get us killed.
I can get us out of this.
I just did that.
Dear God.
WARNING
It was November Ajax.
Pilot Jaeger unknown...
This is the Pacific Defense Corps.
Raise your hands and give up.
No, no, do not give up.
You give up too easily.
That's what they think.
Stop.
You are violating Code 10 Section 14,
operate an unregistered Jaeger.
- Hold on.
- I'm holding on.
Hold on more tightly.
Right.
Stop.
See, I just won from November Ajax.
No, you do not win.
I won.
No.
Okay, what's your suggestion?
And I will not go out.
- Will the Ice Protector work?
- No.
Now they can be in use.
- But we need it.
- Attack all of a sudden.
- What?
- Just do it.
- Strength is only 20 %%.
- I told you we need that!
And it works right?
Computer, can we reboot the system?
This is bad.
Stop now.
This is your last warning.
All right, let's go.
What are you doing to my Jaeger, asshole!
You should have let me control it.
So this is my fault?
You broke into my control center.
Well, your control center?
- Yes. My control center. Yes!
- Sorry, I did not hear you. Your control center?
First of all you have no right to enter without permission
and try to tell me what to do.
- If there's no me, you'll get caught faster.
- And it works fine, right?
- See where we are? - You should know you are
high and what your opponent is.
- True, that's the problem.
- You should be closer. Shut up.
- Shut up. This conversation is over.
- Yes, I can do it.
Good.
Baby scavenger.
Why did you make it?
What happens with closing the mouth?
You said you do not want to sell it,
so what do you want to do?
Rob a bank or something?
I made it because a day
they will come back.
The Kaiju.
When that happens, I do not want to wait for someone to save my life.
Not like before.
Well ..
You ..
Come on.
Hello, Jake.
Violate the law again.
This is just no luck, I
will find a way out.
My father always said, we
who govern our own destiny.
Dad says a lot of things.
You're caught in an unregistered Jaeger.
Wait a minute. That's not my Jaeger.
This has a kid this high .. .. You have criminal records
before, this is serious.
That's why I need my brother,
to help me out of here.
For the last time.
They will not just let you go.
But there may be another way.
Okay. Listen, that's what I want to hear,
let's talk about other ways.
Tell me. What should I do?
Reapply, and complete
what have you started.
I do not want to do that. I'm too old to be a cadet.
I do not want you to be a cadet.
I want you to help train them.
Train .. train what? I do not want to train children.
There is a transport waiting for
to take you here.
For what?
You and your new recruits.
Mako.
I can not believe he just
spoke through the hologram to me.
Akedemi Pilot
Shatterdome, China.
Look, I have no other choice.
I know. I already know this, but why me?
Why do they want me for this program?
You make Jaeger and drive it
own, people like that kind of thing.
Okay, but why am I becoming a cadet
and you're a Ranger?
God.
God, that's Valor Omega.
Scrapper.
Hey!
You must be kidding.
I do not believe they come to you not me.
How are you, Nate?
Now Ranger Lambert.
You made it.
Well, this military headquarters you remember
how it works right, Ranger Pentecost?
You must be Amara Namani?
Yes, sir.
Ranger, sir.
Well, let's prepare yourself.
Oh, and try not to steal anything when you're here.
The man just called you Pentecost?
Like the Stacker Pentecost's Whiz?
Pilot Coyote Tango, a hero
for the whole world ..
It's just a name.
Yes, a cool name.
The training begins at 6 o'clock in the morning, you're late you do not go to practice all day.
Be left behind and you'll be at transport
out of here back to the place where
even they found you.
That, Titan Redeemer.
And Bracer Phoenix.
He's Mark 5 Jaeger.
Saber Athena?
I like Saber Athena.
He's the best when flying, you know that?
Attention, clear the path.
Hey, who are you anyway?
Gipsy.
Are you a Gipsy Avenger pilot?
Formerly.
Until the co-pilot gets a better bid
.
Jules Reyes.
Ajax Pilot.
Amara. Cadet.
Jake, Ranger. Hi.
I heard a lot about you.
- Yes? - You know you still hold
his record?
What record?
Shut your mouth.
So how did you get back here?
The story is long. But if you
want to hear it, we can meet ..
He's my beloved.
Ranger.
Eyes staring forward, Pentecost.
Come on, just hit my face.
Sorry, man.
I won. You owe me 2ribu.
Cadet Ilya, you have to bathe
as often as you can, mate.
The smell of musk, which you smell is the smell of musk ..
Get ready!
Cadet.
This is Amara Namani.
He will join your
, in Jaeger practice.
This is a Pentecost Ranger.
He will help me be your coach,
until I get Ko Pilotku to replace Ranger Burke.
Is there anything you want to ask?
You guys know you can.
Malikova went to headquarters and
prepared to practice with me.
Ready pack!
Disband.
Pentecost.
We will be trained by Pentecost.
Then?
Moreover, it is not him who dies save the world
by closing the hole.
He has not even been in a fight.
Viktoria. Leave us.
Hey.
So ..
- I have to sleep where ..
- You make your own little Jaegermu?
Yes. In fact.
Scrapper.
I am also the one who controls it.
- So .. - If you can just
unify the garbage. Be a mechanic.
This is for the pilot.
Hey come on, I bring your stuff.
Thank you.
Jin Hai, Ouyan Jin Hai, have you got a friend huh?
- Me? - You're friends with Viktoria,
do not call him that.
Yo, what's the problem?
He did not pass 3 selection 3 times.
Yeah, he does not like you to suddenly be here.
Not my fault, recruiters do not come to my place.
Hey, do you speak Russian?
- No.
- Learn a little, it can make it calm.
Come on, let's prepare yourself.
- Warning.
- We have to reconnect.
I know, trying.
- The simulation is terminated.
- I can not do this.
- That sucks.
- Simulation ends.
You know, when you avoid
Jaeger I'm so sure.
I think we have something here.
Now I'm not too sure.
How should I move with this
object. It smells like urine.
I'm not asking you to reason, cadet.
Are you interrupting a snow that almost kills the pilotjaeger?
Maybe he's the only one who does not belong here.
Oh, I know you have a problem with me.
- But come on, he's just a kid.
- We used to be so.
lu the point. We make a strong
relationship as a child.
And that's what makes a pilot a good one.
Yes, I remember his speech. thanks.
Ryuji, Renato, you & apos; re up.
Show this new kid how to do it.
What the fuck is that you wear?
Many people love it. Yes, he told me that I need style around here.
I know I'm fit, I'm sexy.
- Yes.
- Do you want a drink?
Sure.
Thank you.
- Ice cream is at the top.
- Yes.
So again yes? Fun your father?
No, I just avoid jail only.
Yes, I think you're fit to be here.
Yes, I think it fits perfectly here, do not like it.
Jake, these children, they respect us.
We have to show them that we can work together.
Well, for the past 10 years I've learned to talk about something.
You must understand that ..
You have to ..
Sorry guys.
We must understand the purpose of
enemy to defeat them.
We still do not know.
No, I can help you with this.
I think it has to do with sending
huge monsters to destroy our city.
No, no, the precursor will not send
some monsters if it wants to destroy us ..
Listen buddy, I do not have a problem with you guys.
But I have to make a choice
between your handsome face and the prison.
I choose your handsome face.
Oh touch once.
How many toppings do you want?
Forget about my topics, do not interfere.
So the kids have a few months to graduate?
- 6 months.
- Okay.
I'm telling you, when you're talking about stuff that smells soldier, I'll nod.
I will say & apos; & apos; Yes, as per
said & apos; & apos ;, and they will be pilots.
And I can get back to my life.
- Very good.
- Okay.
It will probably be faster
than you think.
- How can it be?
- They plan to replace us.
Shao and his team are currently
presenting this new Drone program.
Could make our work lost.
It looks like a ticket
got out of here quickly.
You know, you can pretend all you want.
But we both know
we will miss him right?
Miss Shao, Quan marshall.
It's an honor to meet you.
Sorry, he did not do a handshake.
Dr. Newton Geizler, head of research for Shao Industries.
It's a tight shake from you.
A tight grip.
- Stop this stale speech.
- Please follow me, lady.
The uniform is perfect for you.
I think it's better than
prison clothes, it seems.
I'm sorry, is this him?
His son Stacker would not you?
I'm Newt, I'm your dad's fan.
Great speech by the way, do you hear how he talks doomsday?
- Newt.
- My friend!
Tell me you have time, I need your help.
Sorry I'm wearing your time for a while,
I hope you're not busy.
- I'm not busy.
- Yes thank goodness then.
I'm also not busy, I mean ..
we better help each other right?
Let's see .. the morals!
We've been in Kaiju's brain, you know?
We find that way, way into the Kaiju brain.
And that's thanks to you and me.
Technically thanks to me, but ..
can you speed this up?
- Placements.
- Hah?
Jaegernya, placement into battle
takes a lot of time,
the longer and more Kaiju
make the damage. Ah this.
I think I have a solution.
Hermann, you know I can not read your writing ..
The booster rocket huh?
Yes .. no.
No, there is no fuel on earth that has such a strong burning ratio.
From this world.
- It is not.
- Is that Kaiju's blood?
Exactly.
I found that Kaiju blood is very reactive
when touched with a rare element, Celium.
- That's what makes...
- Okay, you can not go your way with that.
You can blow yourself up.
I know better about Kaiju than you.
Take a look at this.
No Hermann, I have to stop you.
It makes no difference to this.
When my boss drone is accepted,
placement is no longer a problem.
In 1 year we will have Drones everywhere.
So you do not want to help me?
Listen, why do not we talk
at dinner in my place?
Okay, you can eat well there.
I do not need food, I need a solution.
There is an obvious problem in this case.
That's my boss friend, I'm sorry,
calling duty. Nice to meet you guys.
Newton!
I .. I still have nightmares.
Upon what we witnessed.
When we join the disgusting
brain of kaiju.
Yes.
But...
That's very exciting right?
Dr. Geizler, called the boss.
Yes, yes.
I saw you met with your
colleagues at work.
Yes, we work together in lab ..
Use English, your Chinese language
mandarin like a fool.
I know my language is lousy, we work in lab ..
What do you know about Dr. Gottlieb?
Oh sort of crazy idea put a rocket in Jaeger.
You know how important
your position is in this project right?
I do not want any errors.
I do not tolerate the presence of a traitor
in my place.
I assume he is a dangerous person.
Oh, that person is very harmless.
[SPEAKING MANDARIN LANGUAGE]
Okay, can you repeat the word
again 18 percent slower?
I said do not make me
doubt your loyalty, understand?
Hey, what's the question?
Look, I barely even talked to that person.
Then there is no problem.
You are also better to learn Mandarin again.
I do not like to repeat
my sentence, in any language.
My drone is the next step in Jaeger's evolution.
The system I design receives
commands in a quantum data center.
That means a pilot can
control the drone from afar.
From any location in the world.
As soon as the board approves the placement,
is based on the final report of Secretary General Mori,
days of struggle to find and train
a suitable pilot will only be history.
And you think your
simulator players will be better than us?
We are not here to shut down your operation.
Cooperation between our organizations
never harms each other.
Is there any question?
We are a pilot, not a desk worker!
Be calm, no need to shout.
That went well.
Why not just close
just so I can go?
I can not believe them,
at least for now.
Oh, that seems pretty good to me.
The remote system is so hacked.
Or tricked.
You have a voice right? So you can decide.
I hope I can refuse their plans.
You have to help me speak up on the board.
They will not like my decision.
Who cares what
they like and they do not like.
Then I will come with you.
Tomorrow. Plus I want to get away from this place.
I'm glad you volunteered, because
I've asked Gipsy Avenger ..
as a respectable keeper in the board summit.
You know I'm impossible with Nate.
The co pilot now works for shao.
He needs a new partner.
The one you know is yourself.
All right.
I will do it, I will support you.
But I want to be there when he's upset,
because I know I'll eat it.
He will stand there and say ..
& apos; & apos; No, I think you're not
worthy in Jaeger, Jake.
& apos; & apos; Out of Jaegerku, I'm handsome and sexy. & apos; & apos;
He is handsome and sexy.
Thanks Jake.
Sydney, Australia.
Welcome back, a sunny day.
[TV NEWS VOICE]
So far the police say
at least 49 officers were injured.
This is really a big mess, throwing stones and objects, PPDC gets overwhelmed.
Gipsy Danger, this is Marshal,
All you have to do is stand and be quiet.
Stay focused and look cool.
- Well sir.
- Get ready for disposal.
In 3, 2, 1. Remove!
Jake!
Relax, I can handle this.
Are you sure?
And hey, we are inside
each head okay?
And stop thinking about
Jules, it will not happen.
How about you still thinking about beating me?
That will not happen either.
This could be a long day.
Stable synchronization pack.
Not full, but powerful enough.
Transport approaches.
- Warning.
- Gypsy to center, have you seen this?
Gypsy, come on.
Beware, there is a wild Jaeger.
To wild Jaeger, turn off
Jeegermu and handing yourself.
I warn, turn it off and leave it to you.
Rudak is fired!
Backward!
We are losing power!
Jake, that Jaeger ..
He turns off our communication.
- Nate!
- Full power!
Oh shit!
- What should we do?
- Follow me!
Mako hit!
He will fall!
Activate the pulse weapon!
Mayday! Mayday! We got a shot, maybe we will fall!
- Mako!
- Jake, wait!
Come on, do something, you stupid brain basics!
- Hey.
- Hey.
So .. not very good
with his moves, but ..
I'm really sorry about your sister.
step sister.
Yes, his family died because of a kaiju attack.
My father adopted him.
He is my sister, my family.
Why do not you wear a uniform?
Just to be comfortable after Sydney.
So I feel comfortable.
Do not let Ranger Lambert see you.
He may be very angry.
I think I'm safe, he's on holiday.
So you're still using Sarah's brain.
Yes, but I can not connect
with him either because of what.
All cadets have been practicing
years and I ..
- I hate to feel this way.
- Enjoy.
- If you want to practice, I can help.
- Okay coach.
- Do not call me a coach.
- OK.
Concentration.
We have to make a good connection.
I can not do that
if you do not concentrate.
- Are you ready?
- Ready.
This is it.
Let's see as you can.
Jennifer.
Stay focused, Amara.
Remember. The stronger your connections are, the better the way you fight.
That's it.
- Hold my hand, jump.
- Amara!
Do not fight the memory, just let it flow like a tree.
Amara!
Amara, come here!
Yes, come on. Gathered, yes.
One, two, smile.
Already in the photo.
Want to see? Nice.
Amara, Amara, leave it alone.
Amara!
Just listen to my voice.
Amara!
- Amara!
- Dad! Father!
- Jump!
- Amara!
- Stay with me!
- Jump to me!
- Come on!
- I'm scared.
Do not be afraid, let's jump,
I promise to catch you, come on!
- Amara!
- Jump, come on!
Jump!
Amara!
Remove it!
Hey!
GuavaBerry
Are you okay?
I'm scared.
I'm so scared.
Yes.
I also feel it.
All right, hear me.
- Yes, I'm here.
- Come immediately to the lab,
- Marshal wants to meet us.
- OK.
I'm headed there.
Are you okay?
- What's up?
- All messages.
For months. He tries to send
from the top spot which has been destroyed.
It's a big package in parts.
Sending here with Jenny's airplane. How did the message come in?
It did not work. And
the message is not in part.
So, what happened?
So this is difficult. I checked it out.
Using different algorithms.
I might be able to connect some. This is it.
That ..
It's not Kanzu.
I checked. Of several types.
Nothing matches in the database.
Keep checking, whatever this is.
This is unusual.
I want to know why? And want to know who is named Royager?
INDUSTRIAL SHAO
SHANGHAl, CHINA
Hey, sorry, I'm late.
I got your message. Certainly.
In an emergency, the Council
approves the drone deployment.
Good. Yes. It was great.
A little more hurry
if in my opinion.
Yes, no, I agree. This is great.
With time and everything.
- Assault and feel ..
- I was there.
I know what's going on.
And it will not happen again.
If our drone is in the field.
Warning, there was an error.
Now, everyone understands it.
Yes, they understand.
Which means the attack is something
positive, considering everything.
If you check that fail here,
and maybe you can say that.
I'm sorry, why,
what is going on here?
The Board expects completion
everything within 48 hours.
- 48 hours?
- I have worked all my life for this.
Complete it.
Good. Yes.
- No problem. That's enough ..
- 48 hours?
We will not solve it.
Yes, you do not think there is a way?
Ah, then you're fired.
Well, how about that?
Oh, maybe you forgot. I do not know.
Let's see how it goes.
Just get it done!
Give it to me.
Hey, baby. I am home.
Sorry I'm late.
I think we ..
Today is crazy over what is happening in the city.
All these guys .. Not good.
The boss was almost killed, could have been worse.
Honey, I guess I do not know.
This is great, really. I mean ..
I can not stay away from him.
I grumbled about the job,
stopped talking about it.
Really, I have to focus on you.
I feel we have the greatest ..
How was your day?
That's good, yes, that ..
That's fun. What is that?
Want to tell me a little bit?
Yes, okay.
What can I say?
You read my mind.
I'm sick of sitting and looking at this.
I will never control this.
New species give
new movements, and agility.
Once I ride the robot,
bid farewell to me.
Your father will make you work
with breasts when you lose.
Yes, he will come here with big breasts.
Wait, your dad has breasts?
He is a plastic surgeon.
Does not work with ..
I will not lose,
I will be a pilot.
Still, if we die.
I will give one to you.
Then we are happy for you.
I heard there will be tomorrow.
And Yeager is happy.
All Yeager.
They all held massive.
Victoria.
Bigger is definitely better.
You die.
What did you just say?
You die.
- Did I say it right?
- Yep.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Comrade!
- Every day of my life to make sure ..
You are not doing anything, you just
take whatever is left out, rubbish!
- You want to know? On the street, you're a whore!
- Captain comes!
- He's choking me!
- You're wrong here!
I do not care!
You know, when I first joined
in unity, I was like you.
Worse. I am a nobody.
The woman is the greatest. Mako Mori.
He says whoever you are, some of you follow the program, you join the family.
And no matter what.
No matter how stupid
sometimes they act.
You forgive them.
And you continue.
So you started to believe that.
Here.
And you begin to trust in Yeager.
Hey.
Marshal is looking for you.
Says she found something.
This is not something, But somewhere.
Severnaya Zemlya which
is in the Siberian mountains.
- What's there?
- I can say ..
The difficult location is where
core of the Yeager power.
Not even exist in this world.
That's deep inside.
Why Mako would tell us about a factory abandoned somewhere or somewhere.
Pak...
Mission to bring beginners
to see what's out there.
SEVERNAYA ZEMLYA
SIBERIA
Scans.
It seems that Mako's message is a dead end.
This place is abandoned.
Wait a minute.
I get a weak signal.
Attack!
Incase his legs!
We must get out of here!
Plasma Cannon!
I think we make him angry!
Good!
Remember the way we move?
Yes, of course!
- He looks angry!
- Seek the core of its power!
Towards Obsidion Fury.
Get out of your ward!
What is that?
This is definitely Kaizu.
Second brain to control movement.
How do they understand how we work?
If there is a breakthrough,
sensor will know it.
I do not think there's a breakthrough.
Kaizu Meat has very complexity.
Especially against us.
This one is not protected.
Look, you said that this
is from Alex Lucas?
The genetic expert makes this complicated.
With modification techniques, it's possible
to be redesigned with Kaizu meat.
Done before the war.
You say, deeper than this.
Human use.
My Lord. That carcass will be here.
I'm curious to see the inside.
The inside?
The robot is known by Kaizu.
Come on, man. When do we have a chance to see something like this again?
Never will.
Never a good thing.
You can be here.
I go there.
Amara, come on ..
Amara!
Friend, buddy!
We should not be inside here.
Wow.
This joins the entire system.
Here, the muscle.
That's how it moves.
- Cool!
- Yes. Cool.
Can we see which
is better than this?
Try to light the part here.
What is it?
I think this is silver acid ..
- Ryoichi?
- I told you not inside Yeager!
Go find help! Go!
My note is broken!
Is he going to be okay?
I'm thinking there will be scars,
yes, he will survive.
Marshal says you are all
exposed to probation.
And all of you.
I think better ..
No, not their fault.
- I am trying ..
- I have talked to Marshal But ..
You are freed from the program.
Moreover I volunteered.
Really?
How did you say it
the same thing from the first?
But...
I really do not want to be here. Still do not want to.
Why did you register?
We are at war. My
father is responsible and I think ..
I can meet more of him.
Maybe even fight with him.
But one day I woke up,
that was the stupidest thing I did.
So, I'm declaring it's my fault.
To prove to him I
need not be the best pilot.
- That's stupid.
- Yes.
How much do you get?
- Eh, 7 steps. Some ..
- How far are you?
About 2 steps,
then I lost power.
The best thing to look at when I wake up
is my father standing in front of me.
- Stare silently.
- What he is looking at.
Saying I was removed from the program.
He says I do not deserve to be in Yeager.
He says about everything.
On the day my father was gone.
I did not get a chance
prove him wrong.
I mean .. I failed to prove
to myself.
You listen to me.
Do not let people think
to you reflect on you.
You will not let that bother you.
Do you understand?
Set your head on.
Which will be much
in a deadly situation.
Seriously. Face.
Well organized.
Beauty is a burden.
You will be fine.
Cells are still alive.
What?
I said Fury must have
a relationship.
I do not think it's possible.
Team Josep has checked
every detail on the Yeager.
I see a bad material,
that is mounted upside down in a cable.
The cell is the only one that moves like that.
Amara, are you sure of what
did you tell me?
Yes!
Yes!
He deliberately messed him up.
I'm thinking it might be important.
Yes.
Thank you.
Shoa get involved in this?
They do not even have rights.
Without us knowing it.
Yeager attached
like Yeager example.
There will be more than that
connect Fury to Shao.
What about Mute?
He has
access and delivery to it.
All right, let's meet him.
Do not exaggerate.
Make sure to find it!
We will tell Marshal.
INDUSTRIAL SHAO
Expect caution in work.
The building has been secured, lady.
Do not provide visits when
without full identification.
I do not want anyone
to interrupt the completion schedule.
What's up?
I will be in my office.
Good.
This is not fair.
I'm sorry.
You do not deserve this.
This is my fault.
This is all my fault.
Amara?
See you again on another occasion.
Increase even greater opportunities.
Come on!
GuavaBerry
And we have
100 %% members around the world.
100 %%, that's how it's done. Good?
I can tell this can, and we succeed.
I'm losing control.
Why?
Why? Try another one.
We will bring one that we know.
What about transportation?
Give me a minute.
Rewarding the damaged Drone!
Do not spread to the rest of the other drones.
To Yeager, hurry up!
All units, drones must be destroyed.
Stay calm.
- Doctor Geiszler! Shao looking for you?
- I know.
Hermann.
What are you doing?
How can you be here?
Are you happy here? Because
you're all so messy.
You have to stop everything.
- No. Will not.
- Think about it.
The more you damage it the more
will destroy you.
Help me stop it.
Help me save the world as usual.
You really are ridiculous, do you know?
Are you aware?
Good. Help me to help you save the world.
What do you think?
In my opinion, um...
I said do not shoot!
Perfect.
Shit, why I always
have trouble with you.
What's happening?
- What is Jaeger?
- No, they are drones.
- What are they doing?
- I do not know, they are crazy.
Go back now! Go back to headquarters right now!
Shit, let's go!
Quickly run. Hurry up!
Really? Currently?
Hermann ..
please help me.
This person does not know how to use weapons
.
I do not need this.
I told you we do not need to think about them.
All right.
- We're just the two of us.
- Let's save the world.
Turn off the whole system! Hurry up!
Everything comes out of this lab
, or I'll shoot you guys!
I will shoot you guys.
I thought you were going crazy.
You're fired. Exit.
What should we do?
How to stop it?
There is another way to...
- For what?
- To the drone system.
I've sneaked something
if anything like this happened.
Fucking bastard.
I know.
What did you just do?
Something I've been planning
for the past 10 years.
I will end this world.
HONOLULU
UNITED STATES
Where are my pilots?
Inform the situation!
There are breakthroughs in various locations.
All done by that drone, sir!
All pilots, there is an open door.
Go immediately to the place where
they did the breakthrough.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Why would I want to do it? Because I want to.
I know this is not my style.
But I do not know, I may hate you all for treating me like this.
Maybe that's why, Hermann.
That's why I did it.
But uh...
so it is.
That's the problem.
These days I feel very healthy.
You...
Gosh...
Great you can realize it.
You can not be underestimated.
That...
You've been the mastermind behind.
You have to stop him.
- No, I will solve all this
. Please... - Are you crazy?
- I'm not strong enough.
- You have to...
stop this all...
Look at you.
Enough is enough.
I'm sorry.
But you must be killed.
Remove him.
I will not let you ruin my work.
Oh, hey boss.
What are you doing? You can be killed.
- I had to.
- What are you doing?
How can you do it
without my knowledge?
I guess 38 %% your company
it is machine controlled.
It's really not hard to get me to come in here.
And there to
make a surprise kaiju.
Especially since you always think...
that you are the smartest person in this place.
In a moment, it will come true.
No!
Wait!
We need him.
Hey... listen, they
affect his mind.
Shut up!
Security, locate and stop Doctor
Geiszler. If he fights, kill it.
Better we go up to Jaeger.
Any ideas?
No. You?
No.
- In the third count.
- Good.
1...
- 2...
- Hello there are people there?
Yes.
Jake. Thank God.
We were attacked.
We need you to stop it.
We are working on it.
This is Newt's work, they
invaded his mind.
Could you ask him to stop the drone?
He got away.
- Hurry up.
- Entering the subroutine.
We'll be able to stop it soon.
We must be fast.
They are in front of us. Quick...
Turn them off or we will die.
Now!
Success.
We managed to stop the drones.
The connecting door is closed.
Oh, no.
What's wrong?
3 kaiju got in.
South Korea, Russia, and the East China Sea.
2 categories 4 and 1 category 5.
I understand.
Back to headquarters, we
will need a lot of help.
- Are you all right?
- Yes ma'am.
- What do we have? - The report is still
entered, and there is Jaeger that can be fixed.
All right. How much can we use?
To operate only two.
- That's it?
- Yes.
Well, we need Jaeger as much as
maybe or we will be extinct.
Although it can, the pilot is not there.
One by one. Let's focus on Jaeger.
You, come here.
I need you to hack,
can you do it?
They have updated it.
Can you get back in?
He's quite an expert on hacking even young.
Do you mind?
- Sure.
- I'll try to take care of it here.
Attack!
I have some help.
I've analyzed it.
There are 3 kaiju that burst in.
Well, there must be a purpose
why they are apart.
What do you think?
Maybe they try to connect
something to make their world open.
I'm sure you know their plan.
If they succeed then doomsday.
We oppose them first.
Is there a Jeager who
his position is close to them?
I've tried
contacting them but nil.
I think we are alone
in this fight.
We have to stop them here to thwart it.
Maybe that's where they're headed.
Show the map where the kaiju appeared.
Displaying data.
You know something?
We must understand their purpose
to defeat them.
What if the kaiju did not attack
blindly to all cities in the world?
What if we
just hinder them?
Here.
Mount Fuji, Japan.
Show lines across the points of chaos.
Mount Fuji?
Why?
Rare elements on earth.
What?
Under mount Fuji
there are rare elements.
The kaiju were eyeing the rare element
.
Wait, it does not sound good.
- That's not good, & apos?
- But Mount Fuji is active.
If the black magma is attacked by
by kaiju, its reaction will be serious...
it will start a fire
ring across the pacific.
Billions of tonnes of toxic gas and dust
will fill up to the atmosphere...
and destroy all life.
And the earth will be doomsday.
For the living creatures in it.
We can not let
they approach Mount Fuji.
We do not have enough Jaeger.
Even though we have hundreds of Jaeger,
we will not get in the way of them.
What about your launcher?
No, no. Still not ready.
Can you prepare?
Are you serious? Even with your help,
in theory I can not...
What do you mean by theory?
But... I think I can.
Yes.
Just a little preparation
again and we are ready to go.
Good, are you sure?
We will do it
as best we can.
Hey, take everything you can.
Okay.
Hope you survived.
You too.
That's confusing.
Let's stay focused.
We have 4 Jaeger against
2 categories 4 through 5.
Are you afraid?
We're the only pilots.
Not really.
My father would not like to see me giving a speech.
But you deserve it.
I'm not my father.
Or your hero.
Like Ronny Beckett and Montgomery.
But they did not start it that way.
They start from cadets,
just like you guys.
We remember them with big name
because they are fighting.
Because they struggled together.
It does not matter who your parents are.
Where are you coming from?
Who believes in you and who does not.
Now we are family.
And we are
the last defenses of the earth.
This is our time, this is our chance to make a difference.
And it is my goal to
to finish this well.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Sir.
Pilot Jaeger, do you understand?
Yes, sir.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Sir.
Now help me save the world.
Let's do it.
I'm ready to do it.
Start a connection.
The connection is complete and ready.
So, what does it feel like to be a Jaeger pilot?
Not bad either.
Do not be careless. Stay alert.
We are ready.
We are ready.
Let's start this.
All right.
Control center, we're ready.
All right.
The mission starts in 10 seconds.
9...
8...
6...
5...
4...
3...
1...
Start!
What the fuck...
My grandmother used to play it for me.
Keeps me calm.
But I do not.
I'm not calm, man. No.
This will work.
TOKYO
JAPAN
Stay in command. Look for the right one.
Well, the refugees are already entering the shelter of protection.
You are free to fight.
Understandable. We'll start.
Follow my cue. We are looking for the right one.
Understandable.
The rest against the others.
Understand.
Time to save the world.
Let's get started. After my cue.
3... 2...
1...
Start!
Shoot!
Gipsy, the creature can absorb energy and
use it back as its weapon.
Then I will
attack using another way.
How many
buildings are needed, Jake?
- What should we do? - Comrades,
we need help here.
- Right now!
- Accepted, Saber.
- Nate, take care of the Cyclop.
- Good.
Saber Athena, according to the sensor
he comes from the back.
Enable Earthquake.
Yes, that's right. You
ought to run away.
You think he ran away?
Bracer Phoenix caution direction
clock 6. Attack from below.
Accepted.
Come on!
Okay, that's just a giant robot. Okay,
really original, guys.
I'm impressed. Yes, I'm impressed.
There is movement, moving quickly.
- Liwen, did you accept this?
- Yeah, I turned on the automatic tracker.
That's a mutant from Tokyo.
- Provide location.
- How do I fight it?
All Jaegers prepares for contact.
Attack if they make contact.
Let's go, okay. Attack, invade, baby.
Where are they going?
Now he's getting bigger.
All Jaegers, shoot all the
you have. Wait for my cue.
Attack!
- Guardian resistant attack.
- Cursed me.
Hey, that's a command!
- Attack his eyes! All.
- Which one?
Reyes, last report.
Did you hear me? Come on,
friends standing up.
Guardian Bravo, please provide a report.
Are you all right?
The guardian is disabled.
I'm not sure I can rise again .. cadet ..
cadet is not safe.
Received Guardian.
We must survive as hard as we can.
Where is Phoenix?
You are all right?
A lot of damage but,
we can still fight.
Sir, stable .. Saber Athena stable.
Let's gather in this
coordinate. Let's finish this.
- We are behind you, do not wait.
- Be accepted.
Bracer Phoenix invaded.
Gipsy to command, did you get scans from enemies?
There is no sign of the sensor.
We have Gipsy but
still in recovery.
- No time. Estimate the risks.
- The enemy has a hard skin
- your weapon will not get through it.
- What about secondary weapons?
- This bastard must have a weakness.
- Enemy, has three weaknesses.
- One of three components.
- Sending data.
The rocket is ready for Saber Athena.
Confirmed Bracer Phoenix.
Well, follow my commander do not die.
We listen to theory,
do you want to do it?
Read my mind, colleague.
Evacuation!
I ordered for evacuation.
Amara!
Nate!
Nate! Nate! Stay with me.
Wake up! Nate! Draw it.
Now get yourself a joker pilot!
Goodbye.
Liwen, is there anything you can do to help?
- I need a minute.
- Listen, the enemy already ..
I will not give up. I
will not let that happen.
Jake, you can not operate it without a helper pilot.
I told you you can not!
What will we do now?
- Get together with others.
- Wait!
Gipsy Avenger, this is Amara
Namani ready help coming.
- Amara do not, you will not succeed.
- You did not know.
- Do not!
- Shut up!
I told you so.
- You're the best.
- Amara, use equipment.
We can do it.
Get rid of him.
You can do this, man.
- Are you ready for this?
- One way to find out.
Okay.
Prepare for command. Start the check.
It should be a remarkable
, but it is not.
How do we know?
- Restart.
- Good.
Enemy 2 Km to mount Fuji
climbing quickly.
Gottlieb, do we have enough fuel to traverse the atmosphere?
- Atmosphere?
- Yes.
Probably, but the fuel will not
enough to slow down the landing.
We do not need to slow the pace, we
will come out with a rescue capsule.
I just came out
from my rescue capsule.
Yes, then wear mine.
Jake, there's only one plunger but
enough fuel left.
- Submit location.
- Okay, project it.
Too far.
- We will not succeed.
- Gipsy Avenger, will join.
Most of the system
is online. Sending help.
Be careful.
I found the plunger.
Wait.
- Good, hurry up.
- There's no way it can bring us.
Meilin, good.
I can weld it to your hands, I
just upgraded the equipment.
- Nate, that way we will do it?
- It was not so.
Yes, it was.
- You're a bastard.
- Yes, let's make a mean.
- I'm stuck.
- Meilin, you have to hold on.
- We will not survive.
- Almost there.
- Not enough power.
- Use Canon Fiber.
Hope it works.
This works.
Hold on.
Come on, come on!
- Goals are locked.
- You must exit.
Disconnect.
Amara disconnect.
I will catch you.
I promise.
Come on!
GuavaBerry
Holding on. Gipsy to command,
we will get out of here.
Failure of a rescue capsule.
No, no!
I'm sorry Namani.
For what? We must save the world.
Your father will be proud.
- Amara, look!
- Hey, over here.
- Go, you have to go!
- 20 Km to the collision, get out of there!
- Shit!
- Go, go fast!
Meilin closed the door.
- Hold on! That is close.
- I'm holding on.
[Killed]
No! No!
Okay, plan B, do plan B.
Whoever is listening ..
This is Ranger Lambert, another
unit expected to be informed.
Yes, yes. Glad you're okay Nate.
You are also a man. I'm sure
you can do it.
Well, I'm not alone.
- Good job Ranger Amani.
- Thank you sir.
- The snow is very white.
- The snow is not as white as this.
- Kaiju the dead giant that has ..
- Okay, okay.
Is this the part where you'll give me that long stupid lecture
..
Others do not think
is stupid, that's just your opinion.
- Just me, how many times did you give a lecture?
- That's motivation.
- Okay.
- So, whoever you want.
- Okay, you started it.
- I did not start it.
- Oh, no. You started it.
- Seriously?
Good, nah.
We made it!
You think this is over? You think you've saved your sad world?
We will always come.
We will not stop, sooner or later your world will be destroyed!
Yes?
You think so?
Listen, tell them
we are not afraid.
Tell them next time, they
need not bother to come to us.
Because we will come to them.

You see how it's done?
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.
You better. The boss will chew my head off
if these cores get messed up.
Don't worry.
We're at 26 feet.
You let Jason operate the drill?
Yeah, he can handle it.
I didn't do anything.
Give me your hand!
Let go of the drill!
Forget it, Jack! It's too late!
You're not gonna make it!
Jack!
Jack! Give me your hand!
I've got you!
What were you thinking?
- What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off!
That's what's happening!
We found evidence of a cataclysmic climate
shift, which occurred 10,000 years ago.
The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores...
...indicates that runaway warming
pushed Earth into an ice age...
...which lasted two centuries.
I'm confused.
I thought you were talking about
global warming, not an ice age.
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can
trigger a cooling trend. Let me explain.
The Northern Hemisphere owes its climate
to the North Atlantic Current.
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.
But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs...
...there goes our warm climate.
Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years,
maybe in 1000. But what I do know is...
...that if we do not act soon, our children
and grandchildren will have to pay the price.
And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?
It would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.
With all due respect, Mr. Vice President, the
cost of doing nothing could be even higher.
Our climate is fragile.
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment...
...the ice caps will soon disappear.
Professor Hall...
...our economy is every bit as fragile
as the environment.
Perhaps you should keep that in mind
before making sensationalist claims.
Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off...
...was about the size of Rhode Island.
Some people might call that
pretty sensational.
Stop global warming!
Stop global warming!
I'm at the Global Warming Conference
in New Delhi...
...where, if you can believe it,
it's snowing.
The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos...
...with numbers of homeless people
freezing to death.
Taxi!
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.
Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?
Quite. I was wondering if I could talk to you
about your theory on abrupt climate shift.
The name's Rapson. Terry Rapson.
- Professor Rapson? Of the Hedland Center?
- That's me.
Ive read your work on ocean currents.
- What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.
Over here.
Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland,
where Manchester United...
...leads 3-1 over hometown Celtic.
We return 63 minutes into
the second half as Manchester United...
...looks to put the game out of reach.
Let's get back to our commentator...
...Donald MacFarland.
What? yeah.
- I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.
The baby kept us awake all night.
- And still.
- Yeah!
Dennis? NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing
a temperature drop of 13 degrees.
- Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's....
- Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.
Must have knocked it about.
Kick that bloody ball. Come on!
Come on, kick it now. Kick it!
- Kick it!
- Are the lads winning?
Hello, professor. How was India?
Oh, you know what these
scientific gatherings are.
All dancing girls, wine and parties.
The fury of Hurricane Noelani
stunned weather experts yesterday...
...slamming into the island chain with a
cataclysmic force never before witnessed.
Meteorologists already believe this to be
the strongest hurricane ever recorded....
Are you gonna get that?
It will surely leave a wake of death....
- Hello?
- I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.
Im aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.
I don't have time to talk about this now.
Well, maybe you ought to make time.
Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away
for months and months at a time.
I just don't understand.
I'll let him explain it. Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?
- Sam's getting on a plane?
- He joined the Scholastic Decathlon Team.
- They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?
- yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?
I gotta go because I'm on call tonight.
Don't be late. I don't want
him taking a taxi again.
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.
This morning's weather staff meeting
has been moved to level four, room B.
Jack?
I know you're good at rubbing people
the wrong way...
...but why would you aggravate
the vice president?
Because my 17-year-old kid
knows more science than he does.
Your 17-year-old kid
does not control our budget.
- Who cares if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.
If Raymond Becker pulls our budget--
- Oh, shit!
- Wait-- Will you--? Jack.
Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, the cab's already here.
That's okay. I'll take care of it.
- What are--?
- Here you go.
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.
- Do you want to hear my side of it?
- How can there be two sides?
I got every question right on the final.
Mr. Spengler failed me...
- ...because I didn't write the solutions.
- Why not?
I do them in my head.
- Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.
He said if he can't do them in his head,
I'm cheating.
Ridiculous. How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?
That's what I said.
You did?
- How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.
I'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.
We'll straighten this out.
Hey, you can't park there.
- Don't worry about it.
- Sam?
Sam.
Parker, this is Houston.
We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.
It doesn't look like you're coming back
this week.
Your wife's gonna give me an earful.
Roger that.
Hey, come take a look at this storm system.
It's enormous.
You all right?
He's afraid of flying.
I'm fine.
Statistically, the chance of a plane
going down because of turbulence...
...is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?
- I can't remember if it's a--
- Shut up, Brian.
Listen, Sam...
...don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.
They're still serving drinks.
Folks, it appears we're gonna have a bit
of a bumpy ride for the next few minutes.
Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables...
...and seat backs in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.
Whoa!
Grab it. Watch out!
Sam?
Sam.
Can I have my hand back?
I can't believe I'll be alone
with my mom.
Be patient with her.
She's been looking forward to this holiday.
I know.
I love you.
I love you too.
Hey.
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.
The cause of this extreme weather remains
a mystery, although some meteorologists...
...believe sunspots are to blame.
Hundreds are missing....
This is very odd. There's a buoy registering
a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.
I'll see if there are ships near
Georges Bank to get it.
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.
What?
- What are the odds of two buoys failing?
- Remote.
Make that three.
Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.
Look here, Buddha. These people,
and their cars, and their exhaust...
...and they're polluting the atmosphere.
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.
We're almost there.
- We're only two blocks away.
- Lets walk.
What's gotten into them?
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro...
...defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.
What is his name? Time.
Montezuma.
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.
It's, like, Anta-something.
- Atahualpa?
- That's it!
Time's up. Correct answers, please.
That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.
Next question.
In what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?
This place is so retro, it might actually
be cool if it were on purpose.
Yeah, look at all these nerds.
Hey.
Hey.
You look beautiful.
Thanks. This place is incredible.
Do you believe this is their cafeteria?
You played a great first round.
So did you.
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.
- I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.
- Your schools amazing.
- Would you like a tour?
Sure. That'd be great.
Could you hold this for a sec?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Man, you got some serious competition.
Please.
- And I'll bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.
- Who is it?
- Terry Rapson here.
Sorry to call you so early.
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?
Well, we've found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.
You recall what you said in New Delhi
about how polar melting...
- ...might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
- Yes.
Well...
...I think it's happening.
What do you mean?
One of our NOMAD buoys registered
a 13-degree drop...
...in surface temperature.
I've sent you an e-mail.
Hold on.
At first we thought it was a malfunction.
But there are four more across
the North Atlantic showing the same thing.
This is unbelievable.
You predicted it would happen.
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.
There are no forecast models
remotely capable...
...of plotting this scenario, except yours.
My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.
It's not a forecast model.
It's the closest thing we have.
Nothing like this has ever
happened before.
At least not in the last 10,000 years.
As I predicted yesterday, the swell
off Hurricane Noelani is incredible.
These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.
- Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather?
- This is L.A. What weather?
Wait. What's that noise?
What noise?
Honey, I'll be right back.
The Coast Guard closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for....
- I.A. Weather Center.
- It's Tommy.
I'm in the middle of something, Tommy.
What do you need?
There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.
A low-pressure system along
the California coast...
...is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.
- Yeah?
- Boss, turn on The Weather Channel.
- I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
- What are you talking about?
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess....
- Hold on a second.
- Conditions highly unusual for California.
We're building a forecast model,
we need-- What?
Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.
- Oh, is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.
I would say that
you've lost your mind...
...but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.
- Tom, this is important.
- What's this forecast model you're building?
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet's a hurricane specialist with NASA.
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have
absolutely no idea what he's up to.
Booker. What's going on here?
They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.
Breaking news as we prepare to go live
to Los Angeles.
Mixed reports are coming in about some
extreme weather occurring in the area.
Okay, we're now going live
to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.
We have live coverage now from our Fox 11
chopper. Are you there, Bart?
Yes, I'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast--
- Bart!
- What? Oh! Oh, my God.
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?
This tornado just erased
the Hollywood sign.
The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.
Bart, what can you see? Is anyone hurt?
I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage.
And there are people down there
taking pictures.
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover!
You can't stay here! Get out of here!
What you're seeing are two actual tornados
striking Los Angeles international Airport.
Wait. It looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.
- Tommy!
- Oh, my God!
Holy shit!
I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away....
- Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on yucca and Vine.
- I'm on my way.
- You're on TV. You're in the middle of it.
God! Oh, my God!
You gotta get out of there, man.
That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche!
Oh, my God.
I hope no one was in that car.
For our national audience
just joining us now...
...we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now. Tommy?
If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.
It's one of many tornados
that is destroying our city.
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.
It's unbelievable! It's huge!
I've never seen anything like it.
What's happening?
It looks like some sort of...
...huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing.
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.
- Yes, it is.
- What's happening?
I'll call you back.
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.
On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.
- What do you think we should do?
- Until we can figure it out...
...I don't think we have
much choice, sir.
What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.
Hey, man, I just got off the phone
with my mom.
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.
The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.
Unfortunately, the order came too late
for two planes...
...brought down by severe turbulence
in the Midwest.
- The first flight....
- So much for ''one in a billion.''
All right. All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.
We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time...
...so let's get started, please. Vorsteen?
All our grid models are worthless.
I don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.
Canadians report tremendous circulation
moving from the Arctic.
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system
never before seen.
And Australia just saw
the strongest typhoon ever recorded.
- These things are interconnected?
- We have to consider the possibility.
The only force strong enough to affect
global weather is the sun.
- What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.
Solar output is normal.
- What about the North Atlantic Current?
- What about it?
I got a call last night from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.
He thinks the current has changed.
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?
The current depends upon a balance
of salt and freshwater.
- We all know that.
- Yes...
...but no one knows how much freshwater
has been dumped into the ocean...
...because of melting polar ice.
I think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.
It would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.
Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.
They've asked me to feed it into my
paleoclimate model to track the next events.
Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?
Not just continue. Get worse.
I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.
What are you gonna tell
the Administration?
- What do you expect me to tell them?
- The government has to make preparations.
- You have a theory.
- Give me the mainframe. I'll prove it.
No.
You have 48 hours.
- Professor Hall.
- Yes.
- I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.
Can your model factor in
storm scenarios?
- We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.
Hi, I'm Jason.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Do you have Peter's CT scan results?
Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20 percent.
- Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.
- Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.
Good.
Let me listen here.
Can you read that?
No, but I remember the story
from the pictures.
You do?
My mother used to read it to me.
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.
Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes
for a while.
Call me when you get the results.
Frank, is he always so obsessive?
- Yeah.
- Yes.
Does he ever lighten up?
- Not really.
- No.
- How long have you been working together?
- Well, Frank's been working with him...
...since the Stone Age, but I've only
had to endure two years of servitude.
Jack.
Jack, we got the results.
Six to eight months? That can't be.
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.
Flooding has caused numerous closures,
including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.
The plumbing in the school is really old.
With this rain, the sewage got stopped up.
Where are you staying?
They're finding a place for us
with kids here.
You can't get home any sooner
than tomorrow?
Well, look, Dad, I would if I could,
you know. It's just....
This smell is unbearable, Dad.
Stop kidding around! I want you home.
Dad, I'll be on the train.
Do me a favor. Just don't worry about me.
I'll figure it out.
All right, son. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hey, Sam, guess what?
We got a place to stay.
Great.
So far, the terrible weather hasn't hit D.C.,
but local residents aren't taking chances...
...as people stock up for what is already
being billed as...
- ...the worst storm season on record.
- Better be sure.
- My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.
And I hope to God it's wrong.
- Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.
- You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.
Professor Hall has some information
I think you should look at.
We just got these results
from our simulation model.
- They explain what's causing this weather.
- I'll read it later.
- I have to meet with the director of FEMA--
- This is very urgent.
Our climate is changing violently. It will
happen over the next six to eight weeks.
You said this wouldn't happen
for another 100 years.
- I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.
I wish I were, but you're aware
of what's happening all around the world.
We're making all the necessary preparations
for this storm. What more do you expect?
You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.
Especially in the Northern states.
- Evacuations?
- Yes.
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.
Mr. Vice President! If we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.
Come on, Jack.
Thanks for bringing us here.
I couldn't let you leave New York without
seeing the Natural History Museum.
Of course not. It's a real fine collection
of stuffed animals.
Hey, guys, check this out.
''The body of this mammoth was found
perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra...
...with food still in its mouth
and stomach...
...indicating that it froze instantly
while grazing.''
It's been 24 hours now since the snow
started falling across the British Isles...
...and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.
No, no, no.
You've got to stop worrying. No, no.
It's fine. We've got plenty of supplies.
We're just snowed in.
Yeah. No, it's all right. It's all right.
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.
Yeah, I love you too. Okay, bye.
- Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.
The ferry just landed.
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.
An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter...
...to airlift the royal family to safety.
- Yeah, you think they'll come get us?
- Not likely.
Luckily we've got our own genny,
enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.
Oh, we'll be fine.
As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.
We've got zero visibility.
Maintain heading and speed.
- What's our heading?
- 035, sir.
Approximately 40 kilometers
from Balmorals Castle.
We've lost visual contact with you.
- This gauge can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.
We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.
- What the hell is going on?
- The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.
We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.
Prepare for crash landing.
Select emergency fuel.
Come on, you bastard!
Come on!
What I'm about to say
is supposed to be confidential.
Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.
They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.
- At what temperature does--?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
We had to look it up.
The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.
Can you get a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?
We've got mountains of data...
...but nowhere near enough computer
power to analyze it. Can you help us?
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.
Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.
This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.
This thing looks just like a hurricane.
Only hurricanes don't form over land.
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.
- Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.
- Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.
Wow.
You live here?
Just on the weekends.
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so....
Where is he?
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.
Is this you and your brother?
Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.
It's been raining like this
for three days now.
Come on, hurry up.
I'm just standing here.
You can't stay here.
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.
It's a mob scene here
at Grand Central Station.
Over half the platforms are flooded and
service has been suspended on all trains.
With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service...
...that's bad news for the....
Victor's coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?
Not anymore.
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.
What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.
The cold front moving from the Arctic...
...has created an enormous
storm system in Canada...
...which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more like a tropical hurricane....
I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want a ride?
- Where is he?
- He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.
If this system moves south...
...we could see a wind-driven storm surge
threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.
Okay, bye.
Victor's stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.
It'll be easier to head out of town
if we meet him over there.
- You mean walk?
- No, not in this.
We should take the stairs.
We're on the top floor.
I guess we're walking.
Maybe we should just stay here.
I think the young lady is right.
No. We need to get home.
Hey, Cesar, come here.
What are you doing?
The wolves, they're gone.
Just to give you an idea
of the situation...
...which seems to be becoming worse
with each passing minute:
At the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.
We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out...
...to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.
Car accidents, at least two hundred.
And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?
Hey.
That dog can't come in here.
Come on, man. It's pouring out there.
I don't care. Read the sign.
It's supposed to be a public library.
Come on, guys, this way.
Excuse me. You're bad.
Goddamn 1500-dollar
waterproof raincoat.
- Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.
That's because it's New York.
Hey! Hey!
- Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.
It's out of service.
- I'll give you 100 dollars.
- You don't have to do that.
No, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it.
God, I love buses. This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.
Hello?
- I can't reach my driver. No signal.
- This is insane.
We're not gonna be able to drive.
We should go back.
- Yeah, I vote for that.
- Are you kidding? We have to get higher!
Come on.
Up to the library.
Calm down.
I can't understand what you're saying.
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.
The door is jammed!
I don't speak French!
Hey, where's Laura?
- She was just right there.
- She's right there! Right there, see?
What is she doing?
Tell them to cover their eyes.
There is a wall of water coming towards
New York City. Everybody--
- What?
- Her bag's in the cab. Their passports.
Forget about it.
- I'll get it for her.
- Come on.
Oh, my....
Laura!
Laura!
- Sam.
- No! Brian, no!
Laura! Laura, look!
Come on. Come!
Come on!
Sam!
Professor.
Thank you.
- Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.
- He's 6 already.
- Oh.
No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.
God. I can't believe Neville's 6 already.
You won't believe how fast they grow.
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.
They've run the data we've sent them.
Here he is.
Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?
Yes. The storm's rotation...
...is pulling super-cooled air all the way
down from the upper troposphere.
But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?
It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.
Is this an isolated incident?
I'm afraid not.
We've located two super cells
in addition to the one over Scotland.
One over Northern Canada...
...and another one over Siberia.
And do we know their projected paths?
Yes.
Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren't even close.
This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.
Here's a projection of 24 hours out.
This is 48 hours out.
And in seven to 10 days....
When this storm is over...
...we'll be in a new Ice Age.
My God.
Professor...
...it's time you got out of there.
I'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.
What can we do?
Save as many as you can.
Jack...
...something's happened in New York.
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.
- Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.
What?
This is the last one. Enjoy it.
Greedy.
All circuits are busy at this time.
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.
It was really brave.
I guess I better return her bag.
Sam?
Just tell her how you feel.
Yeah.
- Did you reach your little brother yet?
- No, there's still no service.
Damn cell phones.
Excuse me. Are there any
pay phones on the upper floors?
No, no, no.
- There are some on the mezzanine.
- Great.
- But I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.
Older payphones draw power
directly from the line.
There will be an emergency meeting
of all NOAA department heads....
Oh, God. I've been trying to reach Sam.
So have l.
I tried to call
and couldn't get you.
It's been a madhouse here. Come on.
Are you sure about this?
It works.
I love that picture.
Yeah, so do l.
Where was that taken?
Miami.
Well, where was l?
I don't remember that trip.
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska...
...doing research on your doctorate.
Remember what he was like
when he was that age?
Everything was ''one more.''
One more bedtime story. One more ride
on my shoulders. ''One more, Daddy.''
Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four.
- Sam?
- Dad!
- Where are you? Are you all right?
- I'm all right. We're at the Public Library.
- Sam, it's Mom. I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.
Can you call Laura and Brian's parents
and tell them we're all right?
Yes, of course.
- Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?
Sam?
What is going on out there, Dad?
Sam. Sam, listen to me.
Listen very carefully.
Forget what I said about trying to head south.
It's too late for that.
The storm is gonna get worse.
It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard with
an eye in the center, like a huge hurricane.
Only the air will be so cold,
You could freeze to death in seconds.
Sam?
- Well, what should we do?
- Listen to me, son.
Do not go outside.
Burn what you can to stay warm,
and try to wait it out.
I will come for you. Do you understand me?
I will come for you.
Sam?
- Sam, come back!
- Sam?
Sam, did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
Sam?
- Tell me he's gonna be okay--
- He's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be all right,
Do you understand me?
I thought you'd drowned.
Let's find some dry clothes for you.
Come on.
Where'd you store the arctic gear?
You can't make it to New York, Jack.
I've walked that far before in the snow.
This is not the same.
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.
I have to do this.
I know.
My hands are shak--
- Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.
Here. Come here.
What are you doing?
I'm using my body heat to warm you.
If we let the blood from your arms and legs
rush back to your heart too quickly...
...your heart could fail.
Where did you learn that?
Some of us were actually
paying attention in heath class.
How are you feeling?
Much better.
Frank told me about Sam.
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going,
but there's something I need first.
You have to explain your results
to the Administration.
- I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. This time will be different.
You're gonna brief the president directly.
- Is that the last of it?
- Pretty much.
Okay.
We also found this radio,
but I don't think it works.
Let me see it.
Buddha, keep quiet.
You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.
Come on, guys.
Oh, my God.
The basic rule of storms
is they continue...
...until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.
In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.
This superstorm will last
seven to 10 days.
When it's over, ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.
The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize...
...with an average temperature
close to that of the last Ice Age.
Well, what can we do about this?
Head as far south as possible.
That is not amusing, professor.
Where do you suggest they go?
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't
flooded. Mexico would be best.
Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.
Well, we tried that approach.
You didn't want to hear about the science
when it could have made a difference.
What exactly are you proposing, professor?
Evacuate everyone south of that line.
What about the people in the North?
I'm afraid it's too late for them.
If they go outside...
...the storm will kill them.
At this point...
...their best chance is to stay inside.
Try to ride it out.
Pray.
What do you think he'll do?
I don't know.
Jack...
...thanks...
...and good luck.
You too.
We're all gonna need it.
We can't evacuate half the country because
one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.
- Every minute we delay costs lives.
- What about the other half of the country?
If Professor Hall is right
about this storm...
...sending troops north will
create more victims.
We need to save the people
we can right now.
We take the same approach in triage
on the battlefield.
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices--
I don't accept abandoning
half the country as necessary.
Maybe if you listened to him sooner,
it wouldn't be.
Bullshit. It's easy for him
to suggest this plan.
- He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.
I thought you should know before
You start questioning his motives.
We're going to follow Hall's plan.
- General.
- Sir?
Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate Southern states.
Yes, sir.
Vivian...
...get me my wife.
Sorry, mates,
but we're just about out of petrol.
Hey.
Is there any chance...
...that it'll run...
...on this?
Are you mad?
That's a 12-year-old Scotch.
Gentlemen.
To England.
To mankind.
To Manchester United.
I just....
I just wish I could have seen
him grow up. You know?
The important thing is he will grow up.
Amen.
Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that.
Sir, I am president of the Electronics Club...
...the Math Club and the Chess Club.
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here,
please, point him out.
I'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.
Look, there's nobody around.
You know what? I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.
What?
Hey, man, there are people out there.
I was walking my dog.
There are hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.
Where they all going?
They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.
All right, everybody. Quiet down.
When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?
I got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.
They're being evacuated to the South.
We should get moving too.
The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.
We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.
Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.
We shouldn't go.
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.
When I talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.
- Then you have to say something.
- I know.
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.
What? Listen son, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.
- That's not it.
- Get ready to go.
If these people go outside,
they will freeze to death!
Okay, what is this nonsense?
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.
The people who are caught outside
they will freeze to death.
- Where are you getting this information?
- My father's a climatologist.
- He works for the government.
- So what are you suggesting we do?
We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.
The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.
We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies....
- It's a risk, yeah--
- An unnecessary risk.
No, no. It's not.
We've wasted enough time talking about this.
Come on, people
Let's go.
- Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody--
This storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.
You're not gonna be able to survive it.
Believe me.
Sir, please just stay. Just stay.
Just don't....
- She's set to go.
- Come on, straight to the back, guys.
It'll be impossible to reach each other.
Leave a message for me
at the embassy in Mexico City.
Okay, I will.
I love you.
I love you, Jack.
Tell Sam I love him so much.
God be with you.
- Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.
We haven't been able
to reach Peter's parents.
- I'm gonna try later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.
I got it.
You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.
I've been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I'd let you go alone?
And all these years I thought
I was watching your back.
Where are the keys?
In the truck.
Where do you think you're going?
Neither one of you can navigate
worth a damn.
Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.
I'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.
Good luck, Jack.
Breaking news from
the U.S.-Mexico border.
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border...
...in the light of so many U.S. refugees
who are fleeing south...
...in the wake of the approaching storm.
These people came in anticipation
of crossing into Mexico.
Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.
And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration...
...thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.
The scene unfolding here behind me
is one of desperation and frustration.
People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings...
...and they are wading across the river
illegally into Mexico.
Here it is.
This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 100 years.
All right.
- What are you doing?
- What did you think we would burn?
- You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.
You want to freeze to death?
I'll go get some more.
I'll help you.
I'm going with them.
Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?
Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.
We're not gonna last long
on M&M's and potato chips.
What about the garbage cans?
There's always something
to eat in the garbage.
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can't burn Nietzsche.
He was the most important thinker
of the 19th century.
Please. He was a chauvinist pig
in love with his sister.
He was not a chauvinist pig.
But he was in love with his sister.
Excuse me? you guys?
Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law
down here that we can burn.
After hours of uncertainty,
the traffic is now moving smoothly...
...from the United States into Mexico.
This is only possible because the president
was able to negotiate a deal...
...to forgive all Latin American debt
in exchange for opening the border.
Now, multitudes of American families
are feeling a rush of relief....
Lucy?
Is Peter's ambulance here?
No.
- Why?
- They've all gone.
- What?
- In the confusion...
...I don't know what happened.
People started to panic, and they left....
- God.
- There's a policeman with a snowplow.
- He's waiting outside.
- God.
Peter can't be moved in anything
but an ambulance.
I called and left a message
for the county ambulance service.
Okay.
Okay, you should go,
and I'll stay and wait.
Lucy, no.
- No.
- No, you should go.
He's not gonna wait forever.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.
- All right.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just--
I cut my leg the other day.
Did you get a signal?
Yeah, for a minute.
And?
Man, this storm is everywhere.
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.
Europe is buried under
...and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.
I mean, I don't think your dad's
gonna make it.
No, he'll make it.
He'll make it.
The White House has ordered
a national disaster alert...
...for all Northern states.
Continued exposure to
the approaching storm is deadly.
Remain indoors and take all measures to
stay warm, burning any fuel sources...
...until the storm is over. Roads are
impassable across New York State...
...as far south as Pennsylvania....
Where are we?
Looks like we're just north
of Philadelphia.
Look out!
You guys okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Once again, roads across the....
- Sorry, boss.
Unpack the snowshoes.
We're walking from here.
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.
Why? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.
Time to get up and keep moving.
What we should've done
is stayed in the library.
Okay, guys, let's get moving.
Wake up.
What are you doing?
Insulating.
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.
You know, you spend some years on the
streets and you learn how to keep warm.
Hey.
Thanks.
I got one.
Your favorite vacation.
Besides this one?
All right.
I went to Greenland with my dad on one
of his research trips a few years ago...
...and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.
And it rained constantly.
That sounds really boring.
But actually really nice, you know?
Just me and my dad
hanging out for 10 days.
Frank!
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
I just dropped in to do a little shopping.
I gotta lose this sled.
Hold on! We'll pull you up.
Jason! you've got to support
Frank's weight.
Okay, I'll try.
Okay, I think I have his weight now.
I'm coming to you.
The glass is breaking!
Too much weight.
It's not gonna hold.
No. No.
Frank. I can get you out.
Don't do it!
- No, Frank, no!
- Frank, no!
Frank!
What have you got there?
A Gutenberg Bible.
It was in the rare books room.
You think God's gonna save you?
No. I don't believe in God.
You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.
I'm protecting it.
This Bible is the first book ever printed.
It represents the dawn
of the age of reason.
As far as I'm concerned, the written word
is mankind's greatest achievement.
You can laugh.
But if Western civilization is finished...
...I'm gonna save
at least one little piece of it.
We heard somebody was left behind.
- We brought an ambulance.
- Thank God.
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?
You look like you have a fever
or something.
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.
My mind keeps going over
all those worthless decathlon facts.
- It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.
I guess you just haven't had time
to adjust yet.
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?
Everything I've ever cared about,
everything I've worked for...
...has all been preparation
for a future that no longer exists.
I know you always thought I took
the competition too seriously.
You were right.
- It was all for nothing.
- No, no. l--
No, I just-- I just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.
Truth about what?
About why I joined the team.
I joined it because of you.
Hey.
I know.
I know.
- Mr. President.
- All right.
I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.
We're the last ones.
All right.
Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.
We've got an urgent message
for high command.
Request priority for landing zone one.
Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.
- Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.
- Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.
Madam Secretary.
Raymond.
The president's motorcade
got caught in the storm.
They didn't make it.
And she wouldn't wake up
this morning. l--
She only had a fever.
I don't understand.
She's awfully pale.
None of us has had anything
real to eat in days.
- It's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?
- We've all been in--
- Maybe it's the flu.
No, no, it's not the flu.
And how do you know?
Books can be good for things other
than burning. What are her symptoms?
I told you that she has a fever and her--
She's got a really cold sweat.
How's her pulse?
- It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?
Like a cut that might have
gotten infected?
She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.
I didn't think anything of it.
Oh, my gosh.
That's blood poisoning. Septicemia.
She could go into septic shock.
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.
She needs a massive dose
of penicillin...
...or a broad-spectrum
antibiotic immediately, or....
Or what?
I've never seen anything like it.
There's no point of reference.
All I can see is cloud cover.
What are you doing?
Taking infrared image of thermal currents.
Send to Houston, Korolev,
Your weather service.
I'll help you.
Tom? Tom, wake up.
I just received some satellite images from
the space station. You better take a look.
How big is this thing?
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.
And growing. The two cells
over Europe and Asia are even bigger.
Good God.
This one's gonna hit New York
inside an hour.
Jason!
Are you all right?
Jason!
- What are you doing?
- There's gotta be medicine on that ship.
I thought you said it was too dangerous
to go outside.
I know I did.
Where did you find those chairs?
Why?
I'm going with you.
Me too.
Come on, damn it!
- It's all in Russian. l--
- I know.
- Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?
Because it says ''penicillin''
on the bottle.
Hey, wait. This is the mess hall.
- We should find some food.
- We don't have time.
Listen, none of us are gonna survive much
longer without food. Including Laura.
Okay.
- Sam, over here.
- What?
Bingo.
Brian?
- I'm okay.
- What happened?
All I did was open up the cupboard.
- Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.
Pull him in, Brian!
- You all right?
- Oh, my God, there's more.
My leg.
Here, use this.
It should be over New York by now.
Satellite readings are showing a temperature
drop of 10 degrees per second.
You guys...
...I think we're in the eye of it.
We gotta get back right now.
Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna
lure the wolves out of the room.
When they leave, you lock the door.
Good luck.
- Brian, hurry.
- I need something.
Come on, hurry!
Brian! Brian, open the door!
We have to get out of here now.
Brian, get the supplies.
Oh, shit. Let's go!
Pull, Brian!
Take the medicine to Laura.
We're almost there. Come on!
Brian! Close the door!
Don't let the fire go out!
What's happening?
Buddha, come away from the door.
Come, Buddha, come!
More books! More books!
How long have I been out of it?
Couple hours.
How do you feel?
Okay. What happened?
Well, we had to get inside in kind of
a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.
I should be used to you
pushing me around.
Good to have you back.
What are you doing?
The eye of the storm has passed,
and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.
Shouldn't we wait one more day?
Sam may not have one more day.
What do you think's
gonna happen to us?
What do you mean?
I mean us. Civilization. Everybody.
Mankind survived the last Ice Age.
We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.
All depends on whether or not
we're able to learn from our mistakes.
I sure as hell would like a chance
to learn from mine.
You did everything you could.
I was thinking about Sam.
Jack, you know the chances of Sam....
I made my son a promise.
I'm going to keep it.
Parker, this is Houston. Do you read?
Roger, mission control. Go ahead.
We've got scattered reports that
the storm is dissipating over North America.
Can you confirm?
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.
We're over Europe right now.
I can see landmass
for the first time in days.
How much further is it to the library?
It should be...
...right here.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Sam?
Who is that?
My father.
You made it.
Of course I did.
EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA
Mr. President.
I've just received a shortwave
radio transmission from Jack Hall.
He made it to New York.
He says there are survivors.
Thank you, Tom.
That's....
That's good news.
These past few weeks have left us all
with a profound sense of humility...
...in the face of nature's
destructive power.
For years, we operated under the belief
that we could continue...
...consuming our planet's natural resources
without consequence.
We were wrong.
I was wrong.
The fact that my first address to you
comes from a consulate on foreign soil...
...is a testament to our changed reality.
Not only Americans...
...but people all around the globe
are now guests in the nations...
...we once called The Third World.
In our time of need,
they have taken us in and sheltered us.
And I am deeply grateful
for their hospitality.
We mourn the loss of a spirited leader
whose courageous order to evacuate....
Peter? Hey, you feeling okay today?
For days, we've despaired
about the fate of the people...
...who are trapped in the North.
Today, there is cause for hope.
Only a few hours ago, I received word
that a small group of people...
...survived in New York City
against all odds...
...and in the face
of tremendous adversity.
I've ordered an immediate
search-and-rescue mission...
...to bring them home
and to look for more survivors.
Jack!
It's good to see you.
Come on, let's go get on board.
Look at that.
What?
Have you ever seen the air so clear?

Before time began, there was the Cube.
We know not where it comes from,
only that it holds the power
to create worlds and fill them with life.
That is how our race was born.
For a time, we lived in harmony,
but like all great power,
some wanted it for good, others for evil.
And so began the war,
a war that ravaged our planet
until it was consumed by death,
and the Cube was lost
to the far reaches of space.
We scattered across the galaxy,
hoping to find it and rebuild our home,
searching every star, every world.
And just when all hope seemed lost,
message of a new discovery drew us
to an unknown planet called Earth.
But we were already too late.
Oh, God, five months of this.
I can't wait to get a little taste of home.
A plate of mama's alligators touffe.
You've been talking
about barbecued 'gators and crickets
for the last two weeks. I'm never going
to your mama's house, Fig. I promise.
But Bobby, Bobby, 'gators are known
to have the most succulent meat.
I understand.
English, please. English.
I mean, how many times have we...
We don't speak Spanish. I told you that.
Why you got to ruin it for me, man?
That's my heritage.
Go with the Spanish. Whatever.
Hey, you guys remember weekends?
Huh? The Sox at Fenway.
- Cold hotdog and a flat beer.
- Perfect day.
What about you, Captain?
You got a perfect day?
I just can't wait to hold my baby girl
for the first time.
- He's adorable.
- That's too...
Shut up!
Hey, I'm ready to do this.
Hey, any of y'all grow some balls,
come see me on the court, man.
Hey, hey!
Watch this crossover, baby.
Like Jordan in his prime,
pushing through the front line.
- Step aside, ladies.
- Oh, man. What?
- Lennox!
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Water?
- Thank you.
Are you gonna help me with the gear?
Colonel Sharp, we have an inbound
unidentified infiltrator, 10 miles out.
Unidentified aircraft, you are
in restricted US military airspace.
Squawk ident and proceed east
out of the area.
Raptors one and two, snap to heading
two-five-zero to intercept.
Bogie is in the weeds ten miles out,
not squawking.
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.
If you do not comply,
we will use deadly force.
Copy the bogie.
Tail 4500 X-ray.
Sir, says here 4500 X
was shot down three months ago.
- Afghanistan.
- That's got to be a mistake.
- Check again, then recheck.
- I did, sir.
A friend of mine was on that chopper.
Unidentified aircraft, we will escort you
to US SOCCENT airbase.
- Radar, where's the inbound?
- Bogie's five miles out, sir.
- My wife on?
- Yes, Captain.
- My ladies!
- Look.
Oh, my goodness. Look at her.
She's getting so big.
Look at those cheeks.
I just wanna chew on them.
Baby, we made a good-looking kid.
I know that people say that all the time,
but, wow, we made
one good-looking kid. Nice work.
She has your laugh.
- She laughed?
- Her first one, yeah.
You sure she didn't just fart?
No, she's a lady.
She doesn't know you yet, but she will.
Bogie's on the deck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Radar's jammed.
It's coming from the chopper.
- Will?
- Sarah?
Hey, Sarah, if you can hear me,
I love you and I'll be home soon.
- To the right. Go to the right.
- Check fire.
MH-53 pilot, power down now.
Have your crew step out
or we will kill you.
Hold your fire! Stand by to engage!
My God.
They bombed the antenna farm!
We're under attack!
Go! Move! Move!
It's going after the files!
Cut the hard lines!
I need a key! It's locked!
Move! Move!
Here, come here! Come here!
Here, hide in here!
Oh, my God. Okay.
No!
Oh!
What the...
Epps, let's go!
Okay, Mr. Witwicky, you're up.
Sorry, I got a lot of stuff.
Watch.
Okay.
For my family...
Who did... Who did that?
People! Responsibility.
Okay.
So, for my family genealogy report,
I decided to do it
on my great-great-grandfather,
who was a famous man,
Captain Archibald Witwicky.
Very famous explorer.
In fact, he was one of the first to explore
the Arctic Circle, which is a big deal.
In 1897, he took 41 brave sailors
straight into the Arctic Shelf.
Move faster, men! Move! Chop! Heave!
The ice is freezing faster than
it's melting! Chop faster! Heave, men!
Heave! No sacrifice, no victory!
We'll get to the Arctic Circle, lads!
So that's the story, right?
And here we have some of
the basic instruments and tools
used by 19th-century seamen.
This here is the quadrant,
which you can get for 80 bucks.
It's all for sale, by the way.
Like the sextant here.
$50 for this, which is a bargain.
These are pretty cool.
These are my grandfather's glasses.
I haven't quite gotten them appraised
yet, but they've seen many cool things.
Are you going to sell me his liver?
Mr. Witwicky, this isn't show and sell.
It's the 11th grade.
I don't think your grandfather would be
particularly proud of what you're doing.
I know. I'm sorry. I just, you know,
this is all going towards my car fund.
You can tell your folks. It's on eBay.
I take PayPal.
Cold hard cash works, too.
And the compass makes a great gift
for Columbus Day.
- Sam!
- Sorry.
Unfortunately,
my great-great-grandfather,
the genius that he was, wound up
going blind and crazy in a psycho ward,
drawing these strange symbols
and babbling on about
some giant ice man
that he thought he'd discovered.
Okay. Might be a pop quiz tomorrow.
Might not.
- Sleep in fear tonight.
- Here, you want? Here, 50. 40? 30?
- Sam?
- Yeah. Sorry, sorry.
Okay. Pretty good, right?
I'd say a solid B-.
A B-?
You were hawking
your great-grandfather's crap
- in my classroom.
- No, kids enjoy...
- Look, can you do me a favor?
- What?
Can you look out the window
for a second? You see my father?
- He's the guy in the green car.
- Yeah.
Okay, I wanna tell you about a dream.
A boy's dream.
And a man's promise to that boy.
He looked at me in the eye.
He said, "Son, I'm gonna buy you a car.
"But I want you to bring me $2,000
and three As."
Okay? I got the 2,000 and I got two As.
Okay? Here's the dream. Your B-.
Dream gone. Kaput.
Sir, just ask yourself,
what would Jesus do?
Yes! Yes, yes.
So?
A-. It's an A, though.
Wait, wait, wait. I can't see. It's an A.
- So I'm good?
- You're good.
- I got a little surprise for you, son.
- What kind of...
Yeah, a little surprise.
No. No, no, no, no. Dad!
- Oh, you got to be kidding me.
- See?
Yeah. I am.
You're not getting a Porsche.
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah, I think it's funny.
- What's wrong with you?
- You think I'd really get you
a Porsche for your first car?
I don't want to talk to you
for the rest of this whole thing.
- Oh, come on. It's just a practical joke.
- It's not a funny joke.
- Manny!
- What?
Get your cousin out of
that damn clown suit.
He's having a heat stroke again.
Scaring white folks.
I'm hot! Makeup's melting.
It hurts my eyes.
Here? No, no, no, what is this?
You said... You said half a car,
not half a piece of crap, Dad.
When I was your age, I'd have been
happy with four wheels and an engine.
Okay, let me explain
something to you. Okay?
- You ever see 40-Year-Old Virgin?
- Yeah.
Okay, that's what this is.
And this is 50-year-old virgin.
- Okay.
- You want me to live that life?
- No sacrifice, no victory.
- Yeah, no victory. You know, I got it.
- The old Witwicky motto, Dad.
- Right.
Gentlemen.
Bobby Bolivia, like the country,
except without the runs.
How can I help you?
Well, my son here,
looking to buy his first car.
- You come to see me?
- I had to.
That practically makes us family.
Uncle Bobby B, baby. Uncle Bobby B.
- Sam.
- Sam, let me talk to you.
Sam, your first enchilada of freedom
awaits underneath one of those hoods.
Let me tell you something, son.
A driver don't pick the car.
The car'll pick the driver.
It's a mystical bond
between man and machine.
Son, I'm a lot of things,
but a liar's not one of them.
Especially not in front of my mammy.
That's my mammy. Hey, Mammy!
Don't be like that.
If I had a rock, I'd bust your head, bitch.
I tell you, man, she deaf, you know?
Well, over here, every piece of car
a man might want or need.
This ain't bad.
- This one's got racing stripes.
- Yeah.
It got racing...
Yeah, what's this?
What the heck is this?
I don't know nothing about this car.
- Manny!
- What?
What is this? This car! Check it out!
I don't know, boss! I've never seen it!
That's loco!
Don't go Ricky Ricardo on me, Manny!
Find out!
Feels good.
- How much?
- Well,
considering the semi-classic nature
of the vehicle,
with the slick wheels
and the custom paint job...
- Yeah, but the paint's faded.
- Yeah, but it's custom.
It's custom faded?
Well, this is your first car.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
- Five grand.
- No, I'm not paying over four. Sorry.
Kid, come on, get out. Get out the car.
No, no, no.
You said cars pick their drivers.
Well, sometimes they pick a driver
with a cheap-ass father. Out the car.
Now, this one here
for four Gs is a beaut.
There's a Fiesta with racing stripes
over there.
No, I don't want a Fiesta
with racing stripes.
This is a classic engine right here.
I sold a car the other day...
Gee. Holy cow.
- No, no, no. No worries.
- You all right?
I'll get a sledgehammer and knock
this right out. Hey, hey, Manny!
Get your clown cousin
and get some hammers
and come bang this stuff out, baby!
...greater than man...
That one's my favorite,
drove all the way from Alabammy.
$4,000.
Steve.
Hello, Mr. Secretary.
They're so young.
They're the top
subject matter experts, sir.
NSA's recruiting right out of
high school these days.
Guys, that's the Secretary of Defense.
I am so underdressed.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Secretary of Defense.
Please be seated.
I'm John Keller.
Obviously, you're wondering
why you're here, so these are the facts.
At 1900 local time yesterday,
the SOCCENT Forward Operations
Base in Qatar was attacked.
So far as we know,
there were no survivors.
The objective of the attack
was to hack our military network.
We're not sure
exactly what they're after,
but we do know that
they were cut off during the assault,
which would lead us to assume
that they're going to try it again.
Now, no one's taken responsibility
for the attack.
And the only real lead we have so far
is this sound.
That's the signal
that hacked our network.
NSA's working at full capacity
to analyze it
and intercept further communications,
but we need your help
to find out who did this.
Now, you've all shown considerable
ability in the area of signals analysis.
We're on a hair-trigger here, people.
The President has dispatched
battle groups
to the Arabian Gulf and Yellow Sea.
This is as real as it's ever gonna get.
Now I'm gonna leave you
to your officer-in-charge.
You'll break up into teams
and you'll start your work.
Good luck to us all.
All right, Mojo. I got the car.
Now I need the girl.
I need money to take out the girl
is what I need.
Zero bids.
Great. Broke.
Come on, Mojo.
You want your pain pills?
No. Premature.
Good. What's up?
Nothing. You know, just driving my car.
Driving my car.
It's like clockwork.
All right, I know you get wasted
on these things,
but if you piss in my bed again,
you're sleeping outside. Okay?
That's it for today. No more. Crackhead.
- Ron, this one is uneven.
- Yeah. Probably.
This one is wobbly.
- Yeah. I'll take care of that real soon.
- Couldn't we have hired a professional?
- Sam...
- What?
I do not like footprints on my grass.
- What foot... There's no footprints.
- That's why I built my path.
So why don't you go from my grass
onto my path, okay?
- It's family grass, Dad.
- Well, when you own your own grass,
- you'll understand.
- This... I can't do it anymore.
- You're putting girl jewelry on a boy dog.
- What?
He's got enough self-esteem issues
as a Chihuahua, Mom.
That's his bling.
I want you home at 11:00!
- Yeah, all right.
- 11:00!
Please, for the love of God, drive safely.
Seat belt on!
Wow. You are so cheap.
Well, it's his first car.
Supposed to be like that.
At this time, we can't confirm
whether there were any survivors.
Oh, my God.
Our bases worldwide are, as of now,
at DEFCON Delta,
our highest readiness level.
We're dealing with
a very effective weapons system
that we have not come across before.
But our prayers are with the families
of the brave men and women...
Honey, Daddy's gonna be okay.
I've never seen a weapons system
like this.
The thermal shows this weird aura
around the exoskeleton
like it's cloaked
by some kind of invisible force field.
That's impossible. There's no
such thing as invisible force fields
except in, like, comic book stuff, right?
- Man, I don't know.
- What is that?
My mama, she had the gift, you know?
She saw things. I got the gene, too,
and that thing that attacked us?
I got a feeling it ain't over.
How about you use
those magic voodoo powers
and get us the hell out of here, huh?
When I took that picture,
I think it saw me.
It looked right at me.
All right, we got to get this thing
back to the Pentagon right away.
They got to know what
we're dealing with here.
My radio's fried.
- I got no communication with aerial.
- Hey, Mahfouz.
- How far do you live from here?
- Not far. Just up that mountain.
- Do they have a phone?
- Yes.
All right, let's hit it.
Dude, are you sure
we're invited to this party?
Of course, Miles.
It's a lake. Public property.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, dude, Mikaela's here.
Just don't do anything weird, all right?
- I'm good, right?
- Yeah, you're good.
Okay.
Hey, guys, check it out.
Oh, hi.
Hey, bro. That car. It's nice. Hey.
So, what are you guys doing here?
We're here to climb this tree.
I see that. It looks... It looks fun.
- Yeah.
- You know, I thought I recognized you.
You tried out for the football team
last year, right?
Let's go call your mom.
Oh, no, no, that... No.
That wasn't like a real tryout.
I was researching a book I was writing.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah? What's it about?
Sucking at sports?
No, it's about the link between
brain damage and football.
No, it's a good book.
Your friends'll love it.
You know, it's got mazes in it and,
you know, little coloring areas,
sections, pop-up pictures.
It's a lot of fun.
That's funny.
Okay, okay. You know what? Stop.
Hey, guys, I know of a party.
Let's go, let's head.
You got to get out
of the tree right now. Get...
Just get out of the tree
right now, please.
What are you doing?
Did you see that dismount?
All the chicks were watching.
You're making me look like an idiot.
We both looked like idiots just now.
- Hey, how about you let me drive?
- Oh, no. No, no, no. This is not a toy.
These 22s, I don't want you
grinding them. No.
Why doesn't my little bunny
just hop in the back seat?
God, I can't even tell you how much
I'm not your little bunny.
Okay.
You'll call me.
Who's gonna drive you home, tonight?
Hey, man, what's wrong
with your radio?
- I'm gonna drive her home tonight.
- What?
She's an evil jock concubine, man.
Let her hitchhike.
She lives 10 miles from here, okay?
It's my only chance.
You got to be understanding
here, all right?
All right. We'll put her in the back.
I'll be quiet.
- Did you say, "Put her in the back"?
- I called shotgun.
I'm not putting her in the back.
You got to get out of my car.
- That's a party foul.
- What rules?
Bros before hos.
Miles, I'm begging you to get out
of my car. Okay?
You can't do this to me.
You got to get out of my car right now.
Who's gonna come around
when you break?
Mikaela! It's Sam.
Witwicky.
I hope I didn't get you
stranded or anything.
You sure?
So, listen, I was wondering
if I could ride you home.
I mean, give you a ride home
in my car, to your house.
There you go.
So...
I can't believe that I'm here right now.
You can duck down if you want.
I mean, it won't hurt my feelings.
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't mean here with you.
I just meant here, like, in this situation,
this same situation that I'm always in.
'Cause, I don't know, I guess I just
have a weakness for hot guys,
for tight abs and really big arms.
Big arms?
Well, there's a couple new additions
in the car.
Like, I just put in that light there.
And that disco ball. And so the light
reflects off the disco ball.
Yeah.
Are you new to school this year?
It's your first year here?
Oh, no, no.
We've been in the same school
since first grade.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Yeah, a long time.
Well, do we have any classes together?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Really? Which?
History. Language arts. Math. Science.
- Sam.
- Sam. Yeah.
- Sam Wilkicky.
- Witwicky.
God, you know what? I'm so sorry.
I just...
- No, it's cool.
- I just didn't recognize you.
Yeah, well, I mean,
that's understandable.
No, no, no. No. Come on.
Sorry, I'm just working out the kinks.
You know, it's a new car.
When I get that feeling
I want sexual healing
This radio is, like, you know...
It's an old radio, too, so...
Sexual healing
Look, this isn't something that I,
you know...
I can't get this radio to stop.
Look, I wouldn't try this on you.
'Cause this is like a romantic thing
that I'm not trying to do.
Not that you're not worthy
of trying something like this on.
- No, of course not.
- I'm a friend of yours.
I'm not a romantic friend.
Romantic friends do this.
I mean, I'm not that friend.
I mean, we... I could be.
I feel good
Just pop the hood.
Stupid. Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Whoa, nice headers.
You've got a high-rise
double-pump carburetor.
That's pretty impressive, Sam.
Double-pump?
It squirts the fuel in
so you can go faster.
I like to go faster.
And it looks like
your distributor cap's a little loose.
Yeah? How'd you know that?
My dad. He was a real grease monkey.
He taught me all about this.
I could take it all apart, clean it,
put it back together.
That's weird.
I just wouldn't peg you for mechanical.
Oh, my God.
Well, you know,
I don't really broadcast it.
Guys don't like it when you know
more about cars than they do.
Especially not Trent. He hates it.
Yeah, no, I'm cool with, you know,
females working on my engine.
I prefer it, actually.
- Okay. You want to fire it up for me?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.
- You know, I was thinking.
You know, if Trent's such a jerk,
why do you hang out with him?
You know what? I'm just...
I'm gonna walk.
Good luck with your car.
All right.
Walking's healthy, right?
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Come on, please.
Please, you gotta work for me now.
Don't let her walk away. Come on,
come on, come on. Please, please.
Baby come back
any kind of fool could see
Hey!
There was something
in everything about you
Baby come back
you can blame it all on me
Hey!
Wait a second!
I was wrong
and I just can't live without you
There it is.
I had fun.
So, you know, thanks for listening.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- You... You think I'm shallow?
I think you're... No, no, no.
I think there's a lot more
than meets the eye with you.
Okay.
Yeah.
All right, I'll see you at school.
All right.
That's stupid.
That was a stupid line.
"There's more than meets
the eye with you." Stupid.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God. I love my car.
Hey, guys, I think the other team
figured it out. Iran.
Come on, man. This is way too smart
for Iranian scientists.
- Think about it.
- What do you think, kid? Chinese?
No way. This is nothing like
what the Chinese are using.
This is Air Force One.
Level of flight, level three-three-zero.
We will hunt down this enemy.
And when we do,
we'll know just what to do with them.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Apparently, there are
very few survivors.
Yes, Mr. President?
Yeah, can you wrangle me up
some Ding Dongs, darling?
I joined the Air Force to bring the man
Ding Dongs. I'll be in storage.
Shoot.
Gross.
Do you hear that?
Are you getting this?
I think they're hacking
the network again.
Oh, my God. This is a direct match
to the signal in Qatar.
- Are you running a diagnostic?
- Should I be?
- Yes, you should.
- So I am.
Someone!
They're hacking into Air Force One!
We need a senior analyst.
- I think they're planting a virus.
- A virus?
- It's streaming right now.
- They are planting a virus
and stealing a whole lot of data
from your system at the same time.
Code Red. We have a breach.
Air Force One, someone onboard
has breached the military network.
I'm in the cargo hold. Clear. Clear.
- You got to cut the hard lines.
- What?
- Whatever they want, they are getting it.
- Sir?
Permission to take down
the Defense Network.
- Cut all server hard lines now.
- Cut all server hard lines now.
Someone's tampered
with the POTUS mainframe.
What the...
Shots fired in the underdeck.
Repeat, shots fired.
Crew, prepare for emergency descent.
I want our President in that bunker.
And I don't want to discuss a damn
thing other till that becomes reality.
That's our first priority.
That's our only priority right now.
Air Force One is on the ground.
Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
That's my car!
No!
No, no, no, no.
Dad, call the cops!
Where you going with my car, buddy?
Where you going?
Hello? 911 emergency!
My car has been stolen!
I'm in pursuit! Right?
I need all units, the whole squadron.
Bring everyone!
No, don't ask me questions, all right?
My father's the head
of the neighborhood watch!
Oh, my God.
My name is Sam Witwicky.
Whoever finds this, my car is alive,
okay? You saw that?
Since this is my last words on Earth,
I just wanna say, Mom, Dad, I love you,
and if you find Busty Beauties
under my bed, it wasn't mine.
I'm holding it for Miles.
No, no, wait that...
Okay, that's not true. It's mine
and Uncle Charles gave it to me.
I'm sorry. Mojo, I love you.
No! No! No! No!
Oh, my God.
No, you're a good dog!
Good dog! Good dog!
Oh, my God.
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! All right! Oh!
No! No!
Okay. Please, please don't kill me!
I'm sorry! Take the keys!
I don't want them! Car's yours!
Listen, listen, listen.
- Good, you're here.
- Let me see your hands!
- No, no, no! It's not me!
- Let me see your hands.
- The guy's inside.
- Shut up! Walk towards the car.
Put your head on the hood.
Whoever did this finally managed
to infiltrate our defense network,
which is what they tried to do in Qatar,
only this time it worked.
- What did they get?
- We still don't know.
- Talk to me about the virus.
- It's a Spider-bot virus.
We're not sure what it's going to do,
but it may cripple the system.
- Can we stop it?
- Every time we try an antivirus,
it adapts and speeds up.
It's like it's not a virus anymore.
It's become the system.
Obviously the first phase
of a major attack against the US.
The only countries
with this kind of capability
are Russia, North Korea, maybe China.
- I'm sorry, that's not correct.
- Excuse me, young lady.
I didn't see you standing there.
You would be who?
I'm just the analyst
who detected the hack.
Hold on. It was you? You did it?
- Her team.
- Sir, I was just trying to say,
they hacked your firewall in 10 seconds.
Okay. Even a supercomputer
with a brute force attack
would take 20 years to do that.
Maybe you can explain, then,
how our latest satellite imagery
shows North Korea
doubling its naval activity.
Maybe it's a precaution,
because isn't that what we're doing?
The signal pattern is learning.
It's evolving on its own.
And you need to
move past Fourier transfers
and start considering
quantum mechanics.
There is nothing on Earth that complex.
What about an organism?
A living organism?
Maybe some kind of
DNA-based computer?
- And I know that that sounds crazy...
- That's enough. That's enough.
We have six floors of analysts
working on this thing.
Now, if you can find proof to back up
your theory,
I'm gonna be happy to listen to you.
But if you don't get a filter
on that brain-mouth thing, you're gonna
be off the team. You understand?
Look, I can't be any clearer
than how crystal clear I am being.
- It just stood up.
- It just stood up.
Wow. That's really neat.
Okay, chiefie.
Time to fill her up. And no drippy-drippy.
What are you rolling?
Whippets? Goofballs?
A little wowie sauce with the boys?
- No, I'm not on any drugs.
- What's these?
Found it in your pocket. "Mojo."
Is that what the kids are doing now?
Little bit of Mojo?
- Those are my dog's pain pills.
- You know, a Chihuahua. A little...
What was that?
You eyeballing my piece, 50 Cent?
You wanna go?
Make something happen. Do it.
'Cause I promise you I will bust you up.
Are you on drugs?
Let's hope this telephone line works.
Hey, heads up!
Heads up! Hey! Heads up!
What the heck was that?
English, dude. English.
Whoa!
Watch out!
- Open fire!
- Contact! Contact!
Everybody, quiet. Settle.
Whoa, mother... What the hell is...
Get up! Get up! Come on!
Go! Move it!
Take cover!
Fig! Cover the rear!
Cover fire! Move it! Fig, cover the rear!
Epps! Cover the rear! Move it!
Come on! Give me a mag!
Where's your papa?
Where's your papa?
Papa!
Sir, we need... I need a telephone.
- Telephone, telephone, yes!
- Telephone!
Hey, I need a mag! Give me a mag!
- Cell phone!
- I don't know how to thank you.
Fire!
This is an emergency Pentagon call!
I need you to... Do you understand?
It's an emergency Pentagon...
I don't have a credit card!
Sir, the attitude is not going to speed
things up any bit at all.
I'm going to ask you to speak
into the mouthpiece very clearly.
I'm in the middle of a war!
This is frigging ridiculous!
Ammo!
I need a credit card!
- Epps! Where's your wallet?
- Pocket!
- Which pocket?
- My back pocket!
- You got 10 back pockets!
- Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!
All right, keep shooting! Keep shooting!
Okay, it's Visa.
Also, sir, have you heard about
our premium plus
world-service gold package?
No, I don't want a premium package!
Epps! Pentagon!
Give me a status.
Sir, we're tracking a Special Ops team
under fire in Qatar.
They say they're survivors
of the base attack.
Survivors?
I ain't never seen this in my life!
Need gunships on station ASAP!
Predator's coming up in a minute.
We're linking the call
to the nearest AWACS.
Unknown, man. I don't...
Man, if you seen this shit...
Predator ETA two minutes.
Hey! Make way!
- What is that?
- I don't know.
We need air support
and we need it now.
Roll in strike package Bravo
on unknown target.

Attention, all aircraft. This will be
a danger close-fire mission.
Weapons, I just got a call
from Falcon Ops.
Who's closer to Kill Box One Alpha?
- Send the Hogs, sir.
- Okay, send the Hogs over
to Kill Box One Alpha.
It's a danger close...
Switch the Hogs to Kill Box One Alpha,
Friendlies in the area.
Seven-man team

You're clear and hot!
Strike, tell me status of Hog right now.

Laze target!
- Ready! Heat's coming!
- What? Bring it!
Receiving radar jamming

No frigging way
that thing's still not down.
Spooky Three Two, use 105 shells.
Bring the rain.
Be advised, ground team is requesting
Did we lose them?

Where's Fig?
- Fig? Fig?
- Oh, God!
- God damn it!
- Get a medic!
Get a medic!
- I'm sorry.
- Black Hawk...
We'll get a medic. Just hold on.
He's got a pulse.
We need a medevac. One man down.
Patient care category urgent.
Bring them home.
You get those men stateside right now.
I want them debriefed in 10 hours.
There's only one hacker in the world
who can break this code.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Stop!
I am sorry to bother you.
- Maggie?
- Listen, I need your help.
No! This is my private area,
my place of Zen and peace.
- Listen to me.
- Glen! Who is it?
Shut up, Grandma!
- What are you doing here?
- Just give me a break, will you, please?
Grandmama! Drink your prune juice!
- What level are you on, man?
- Six.
Oh, here come the matrix!
Here come the matrix!
Glen, seriously, don't you
want to see something classified?
Yeah. Get low.
- Here we go. Here we go. Double tap.
- Hey, I just paused it. I just paused it.
Hey. I need a moment.
- Please.
- Sorry.
Hey, man, save my game.
How classified?
Like "I will go to jail for the rest of
my life for showing you" classified.
Yes! One quick peek.
Special Ops got a thermal snapshot
of whatever hit the base in Qatar.
- I want to see it.
- Well, the imager was damaged, sir.
The rangers are en route
with the imager,
but we also have a security issue.
Circle logs indicate one of
the analysts made a copy
of the network intrusion signal.
The signal strength is through the roof.
Where did you say you got this?
It hacked the national military
air-guard frequency
in less than a minute.
- No way.
- Yeah.
Looks like there's a message embedded
in the signal. Let me work my magic.
"Project Iceman"?
- What's Sector Seven?
- Who is Captain Witwicky?
Are you playing
those video games again?
Cops! Cops!
FBI! Clear right!
Lock it down! Lock it down!
Cops!
Lock it down.
Wait! I'm just a cousin! I'm just a...
Get off my Grandmama's carpet!
She don't like nobody on the carpet!
Especially police!
It was an awesome spectacle here
an hour ago
when over 40 C-17 s lifted off
of this very base.
We're not told where they're going.
Morning, Mo.
The government has been very quiet
about what's going on but in our...
- Mojo. Mojo.
- They were headed directly
towards North Korea.
Stop with the barking, Mojo.
It's too early. Please?
Miles? Miles, listen to me. Listen.
- My car, it stole itself, okay?
- What are you talking about, man?
Satan's Camaro. In my yard.
It's stalking me.
Stop!
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God!
Sam?
Hi.
That was... That was really awesome.
- Well, it felt awesome.
- Are you okay?
I'm not okay, all right?
I'm losing my mind a little bit.
I'm getting chased by my car right now.
I got to go.
You know what?
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
Oh, great. Cops.
Officer!
Listen!
Oh, that hurt.
Listen to me!
Thank God you're here!
I've had the worst day ever!
I've been... I've been followed here
on my mother's bike! Right?
And my car's right there
and it's been following me here!
So get out of the car! No! Stop!
Oh, God. Okay, okay! Okay, all right!
Okay! I'm sorry! I'm...
I didn't mean to hit your car! Look!
Okay, look, look, look! Stop, stop!
Please! Okay,
what do you want from me?
Okay.
Oh, God, no! No!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit, shit, shit!
Oh, God! Oh, shit!
It's a bad dream.
Are you username LadiesMan217?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Are you username LadiesMan217?
Yeah.
Where is eBay item 21153?
Where are the glasses?
Get back!
Stop!
God!
What is your problem, Sam?
Okay, there's a monster right there!
It just attacked me!
Here he comes! All right, get up.
Get up and run! You have to run! Okay.
Sam, what is that thing?
- You have to get in the car. Get in.
- I don't want to.
- Get in the car. Trust me. Trust me!
- Sam.
Get in! Go, go, go, go, go.
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
No, we're not. No, we're not gonna die.
- Oh, my God!
- Trust me. He's a kick-ass driver!
Oh, my God! No!
We're gonna die!
Oh, my God!
We're locked in.
The car won't start.
At least we ditched the monster, right?
Okay.
Time to start.
He's got me! Oh, God!
He's going to kill me!
No. No, no, no!
Get off!
Kill it! Kill it!
Get it, get it, get it, get it!
Not so tough without a head, are you?
Here, come on.
What is it?
It's a robot.
But like a...
Like a different...
You know, like a super-advanced robot.
It's probably Japanese.
Yeah, it's definitely Japanese.
What are you doing?
I don't think it wants to hurt us.
It would have done that already.
Really? Well, do you speak robot?
Because they just had, like,
a giant droid death match.
- I think it wants something from me.
- What?
Well, 'cause the other one was
talking about my eBay page.
You are the strangest boy
I have ever met.
- Can you talk?
- XM Satellite Radio...
Digital cable brings you...
... Columbia Broadcasting System...
So you... You talk through the radio?
Thank you, you're beautiful.
You're wonderful, you're wonderful.
So, what was that last night?
What was that?
Message from Starfleet, Captain...
Throughout the inanimate vastness
of space...
Angels will rain down
like visitors from heaven! Hallelujah!
Visitors from heaven? What...
What are you,
like, an alien or something?
Any more questions you want to ask?
He wants us to get in the car.
And go where?
Fifty years from now,
when you're looking back at your life,
don't you want to be able to say
you had the guts to get in the car?
This car's a pretty good driver.
I know.
Why don't you go sit in that seat, there?
I'm not going to sit in that seat.
He's driving.
Yeah.
You're right.
- Well, maybe you should sit in my lap.
- Why?
Well, I have the only seat belt here.
You know, safety first.
- Yeah, all right.
- Right?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
There, see? That's better.
- Okay.
- Okay.
You know, that seat belt thing was
a pretty smooth move.
Thank you.
You know what I don't understand?
Why, if he's supposed to be, like,
this super-advanced robot,
does he transform back
into this piece-of-crap Camaro?
Whoa! Whoa!
Oh, see? No. Get...
No, that doesn't work. See?
Move it, you moron!
Great, now... See?
Fantastic.
Now you pissed him off.
That car is sensitive.
I mean, $4000 just drove off.
What?
This is you...
Oh, my God!
Come on, let's go.
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Explosions everywhere!
This is easily a hundred times cooler
than Armageddon. I swear to God!
Fire, fire, fire, fire!
Whoa! Sweet!
Oh, dude, I hope this guy's got
asteroid insurance,
'cause he is so boned!
What is that?
There's something in the tree, dude.
No, there's something
in the thing by the tree!
Could you guys just give me
a space rock?
Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?
Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing
out here by yourself?
Holy God! What happened to the pool?
Are you Samuel James Witwicky,
descendent of Archibald Witwicky?
They know your name.
Yeah.
My name is Optimus Prime.
We are autonomous robotic organisms
from the planet Cybertron.
- But you can call us Autobots for short.
- Autobots.
- What's cracking, little bitches?
- My first lieutenant. Designation, Jazz.
This looks like a cool place to kick it.
What is that?
How did he learn to talk like that?
We've learned Earth's languages
through the World Wide Web.
My weapons specialist, Ironhide.
- You feeling lucky, punk?
- Easy, Ironhide.
Just kidding.
I just wanted to show him my cannons.
Our medical officer, Ratchet.
The boy's pheromone level suggests
he wants to mate with the female.
You already know
your guardian, Bumblebee.
Bumblebee, right?
Check on the rep
Yep, second to none
So you're my guardian, huh?
His vocal processors were damaged
in battle. I'm still working on them.
Why are you here?
We are here looking for the All Spark.
And we must find it before Megatron.
Mega-what?
Our planet was once a powerful empire,
peaceful and just,
until we were betrayed by Megatron,
leader of the Decepticons.
All who defied them were destroyed.
Our war finally consumed the planet,
and the All Spark was lost to the stars.
Megatron followed it to Earth,
where Captain Witwicky found him.
My grandfather.
It was an accident
that intertwined our fates.
Come back!
I think the dogs have found something.
The ice is cracking!
Captain! Grab my rope, Captain!
I'm all right, lads!
Can we throw you a rope, Captain?
Megatron crash-landed
before he could retrieve the Cube.
Men! We've made a discovery!
He accidentally activated
his navigation system.
The coordinates to the Cube's location
on Earth were imprinted on his glasses.
How'd you know about his glasses?
- eBay.
- eBay.
If the Decepticons find the All Spark,
they will use its power to transform
Earth's machines and build a new army.
And the human race
will be extinguished.
Sam Witwicky,
you hold the key to Earth's survival.
Please tell me
that you have those glasses.
It's like
a self-regenerating molecular armor.
Look at the scorch mark
where the sabot round hit.
Melted right through.
Hey, aren't sabots hot-loaded for, like,
a 6,000-degree magnesium burn?
Close to it. It melts tank armor.
So this metal skin must react
to extreme heat.
- Heads up!
- Oh!
I thought you said
that thing was dead, man!
Strap it down! Strap it!
This thing is wicked.
All right, get on the horn
with Northern Command.
Tell them that our effective weapon
is high-heat sabot rounds.
Recommend we load them
on all the gunships. Go.
You want that piece?
Okay, Maggie, look. Let me break
it down to you how it's gonna happen.
They gonna come through that door
and be good cop, bad cop.
Don't fall for that, all right?
That's why I ate their food.
See, they put the plate of donuts
out here to test your guilt.
If you don't touch it, you're guilty.
I ate the whole plate.
The whole plate. Okay?
It's me and you.
They walk through that door,
you don't say nothing.
She did it! She did it!
She's the one you want! All right?
I was just sitting at home
watching cartoons,
playing video games with my cousin,
and she came in there.
- And then...
- Glen, you freak.
Hey! I am not going to jail for you
or anybody else!
I have done nothing bad my entire life!
Hey, man, I'm still a virgin.
Okay, so what?
I've downloaded a couple of
thousand songs off the Internet.
Who hasn't? Who hasn't?
- I promise!
- Glen, shut up!
No, you shut up! Don't talk to me!
Don't talk to me, criminal!
- Oh, sugar rush.
- This is... This is not his fault.
See? So can I go home now?
- Oh, okay. I won't.
- But just listen to me.
Okay, whoever hacked into your military
system downloaded a file, all right?
It was something about
someone named Witwicky
and some government group, right?
Named Sector Seven.
You have to let me talk to
Defense Secretary Keller
before you go to war
with the wrong country!
Whatever fell out of the sky
ended up right behind...
- What did he say?
- What?
- Did he hear it, too?
- Yeah, Jack heard it, too. Yeah.
- What does he think it is?
- He thinks it's a military experiment.
- What a knucklehead.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a plane.
Still no official word as to
what happened. You can see...
- Yeah!
- Call Sam.
- Yeah. Why?
- He should be home in 15 minutes.
Well, I'll call him in 15 minutes.
If you wait 15 minutes, he'll be late
and you'll have to ground him.
Well, I can't ground him
if he's not late, can I?
I need you to stay here, all right?
You got to stay here
and you're gonna watch them.
- Okay, okay.
- All of them.
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah, okay, okay.
Five minutes, all right?
- Thanks for staying on my path.
- Oh, yeah. No, no, Dad. Hey!
The... Oh, the path. I'm sorry.
I forgot about the path.
I'm gonna sweep the whole thing
right now. How about that?
- You know, I buy half your car...
- Yeah.
...then I bail you out of jail and then
I just decided to do all your chores.
- The chores.
- Yeah. Life is great, huh?
Life... Life is fantastic, is how good it is.
It's so... Oh, the trash cans. Sorry, Dad.
I'm gonna do the trash cans now.
No, no, I don't want you
to strain yourself.
No, no, I won't strain myself, Dad.
- I'll do it.
- It would hurt my feelings if you do it.
- You sure? I don't mind, I don't...
- I promise...
No, no, no, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do the trash cans
and I'm gonna scrape the grill
and I'm gonna... I'm gonna sweep up
the whole house right now.
- Tonight, right now?
- Right now.
The...
I love you. God, I love you
just so much right now.
You know,
Mom wanted me to ground you.
- You're three minutes late.
- Right?
Oh, well, just another thing
you did for me, Dad,
because you're such a swell guy.
One more thing, huh?
All right, I love you!
Sleep good, handsome man!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
No, watch the path! Watch the path!
Watch the... Please, please, please.
No, no, wait. No, no, no! Oh, no!
- Sorry. My bad.
- Oh, I... You couldn't...
You couldn't wait for five...
You couldn't wait for five minutes?
I told you to just stay! Just stay! God!
- I told you to watch them. I told you.
- Okay, you know what?
- They seem to be in a little bit of a rush.
- Oh, this is bad. No!
Mojo, Mojo! Off the robot! God!
- Oh, wet.
- No, no, no, no, no! Easy! Easy!
Hold on! Hold! This is Mojo.
This is Mojo. He's a pet of mine.
He's a pet. Okay? That's all.
If you could just put the guns away...
- Put the... Put them away. Please.
- You have a rodent infestation.
- A what?
- Shall I terminate?
No, no, no, no.
He's not a rodent, he's a Chihuahua.
This is my... This is my Chihuahua.
We love Chihuahuas! Don't we?
He's leaked lubricants all over my foot.
- He peed on you? Bad Mojo. Bad Mojo!
- Bad Mojo!
I'm sorry.
He's got a male dominance thing.
That's all it is.
- My foot's gonna rust.
- All right.
Okay, okay.
- Shut up and go hide!
- Just hurry.
Autobots, recon.
I hope he's okay. He's in the kitchen.
Got some ice on his nose.
I had to slap him around a little bit.
You did not.
- You didn't even ground him.
- Almost, almost.
Where are they? No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, come on.
- What? What is this?
- Time is short.
- They really want those glasses.
- Come on. What are you doing?
- I'm gonna help you.
- Okay.
- Please hurry.
- Okay.
- Yeah, no, no. It's definitely gone.
- What do you mean?
My glasses were in the bag.
They were in the backpack
and now the backpack isn't here.
Well, they're gonna be pissed,
so what do you wanna do?
So what I think you should do is
you should...
You should check this whole...
This whole section here.
Just give it a clean sweep,
and I'll get the corner here.
Yeah, no, no, no. Not there.
That's my... That's my private...
- Sorry. That's nothing.
- You just...
- You just told me to look...
- I know,
but I didn't mean to look inside
of my treasure chest.
You should be way more specific
so I don't get in trouble in your room.
I'm already stressed out enough.
Okay. What now?
No. No, no. No, no, no.
This isn't hiding. This isn't hiding.
This is my backyard, not a truck stop.
Oh, God. Oh!
Okay, I saw it. The UFO landed
right here and now it's gone.
My moped's under there, man!
Who's gonna pay for that?
Sam? Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam.
- He's back here.
- I can't deal with this. I can't...
What? Oh, no, no, no.
- This is my mother's flower...
- Oops.
Okay, listen. You got to listen to me.
If my parents come out here
and see you, they're gonna freak out.
My mother's got a temper, okay?
We must have the glasses.
I know you need the glasses.
I've been looking everywhere.
They're not here.
They're definitely not here.
Keep searching.
I need you to be quiet for five minutes.
Ten minutes. Okay?
Please, I'm begging you. You got to...
You're making a racket.
I can't concentrate.
You want me to look and I'm hearing...
Calm down, calm down.
You got to do something here.
You got to do something here.
- Autobots, fall back.
- Thank you. Please, for five minutes.
Good? Good? Okay.
- Move!
- Get away!
What's the matter with you?
Can't you be quiet?
He wants us to be quiet.
Earthquake! Move, move, move, move,
move! Earthquake!
Judy! Judy, get under the table! Move it!
Duck and cover right now!
How did you get over there so fast?
Wow! That was tingly!
- You got to try that!
- Yeah, that looks fun.
- Sam?
- Sammy?
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.
- Sam?
- That's weird.
- Sam!
- Ratchet, point the light.
- Come on, hurry.
- Listen, we got a major issue in here.
What's with the light?
You gotta stop the light.
What's going on? Turn it off.
You gotta tell him to shut it off.
- Shut it off.
- Sam, are you in there?
How come the door's locked?
You know the rules.
No doors locked in my house!
You know he'll start counting
- if you don't open the door!
- One more chance. Five...
Oh, dear.
- Four. It's coming off the hinges, pal.
- He's counting!
- Sam, just open the door.
- Three.
- Oh, my.
- Two.
- He's counting.
- Stand back.
- What's up? What's with the bat?
- Who were you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.
- Why are you so sweaty and filthy?
I'm a child. You know, I'm a teenager.
We heard voices and noises
and we thought maybe you were...
It doesn't matter what we thought.
What was that light?
No, what light? What?
There's no light, Dad! There's no light!
You got two lights in your hand!
That's what it is.
- Maybe it bounced...
- There was light under the door.
Look, you can't... You can't just bounce
into my room like that.
You got to knock.
You got to communicate.
- We knocked for five minutes.
- I'm a teenager.
- We knocked.
- You didn't knock.
- You were screaming at me, okay?
- No.
This is repression,
what you're doing here.
- You're ruining my youth, okay?
- Oh, for Pete's sakes!
You are so defensive!
Were you masturbating?
- Judy.
- Was I...
- No, Mom.
- Zip it, okay?
- It's okay.
- No, I don't masturbate!
That's not something for you
to bring up.
- That's a father-and-son thing, okay?
- Father-son thing.
I mean, you don't have to call it that
word if that makes you uncomfortable.
You can call it Sam's happy time or...
- Happy time?
- ...my special alone time...
- Stop.
- Mom.
- Judy, stop.
- ...with myself.
- Mom, you can't come in and...
- I'm sorry.
It's just been a weird night.
I've had a little bit to drink.
- No, no, Dad.
- Yeah, well, we saw a light.
Oh, parents.
I don't know where it was, but we saw it.
Earthquake! It's another one! Another
earthquake! Get in the doorway!
- Okay!
- Aftershock! Aftershock!
Oh, I hate these.
- Got to ride it out. Ride it out!
- Quick, hide.
- Hey, the lights are back on.
- Hide? What?
- Where?
- Come on, get out of that tub.
Can't you take safety seriously?
- Good Lord, this floor is filthy, Sam.
- Oh, oh, man! Man. Oh.
Oh, no! Look at the yard.
The yard is destroyed.
Judy? Better call the city.
We got a blown transformer!
Power pole's sparking all over
the place!
Oh, man. Yard's a waste.
Trashed. Gone.
- It's a wash. The whole yard.
- You're kidding.
The parents are very irritating.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Can I take them out?
Ironhide, you know
we don't harm humans.
What is with you?
Well, I'm just saying we could.
It's an option.
We heard you talking
to somebody, Sam.
- We wanna know who.
- Mom, I told...
Hi. I'm Mikaela.
I'm a... I'm a friend of Sam's.
Gosh, you're gorgeous.
Isn't that the prettiest girl?
- She can hear you talking, Mom.
- Thank you.
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry you had to
hear our little family discussion about...
- Sorry that we're bugging you.
- Do you have my backpack?
- Come on, hon. Let's go.
- Oh, it's in the kitchen.
Oh, yes. Okay. Okay.
- Yeah.
- Your mom's so nice.
I want you to distract my parents
while I slip out and get these glasses
to them, okay?
- Ronald Wickity?
- It's Witwicky. Who are you?
We're the government. Sector Seven.
- Never heard of it.
- Never will.
Your son's the great-grandson
of Captain Archibald Wickity, is he not?
It's Witwicky.
May I enter the premises, sir?
Ron, there's guys all over the front yard.
What the heck is going on here?
Your son filed a stolen car report
last night.
We think it's involved in
a national security matter.
- They're ripping up my rose bushes!
- National security?
That's right. National security.
My God, Ron, they're everywhere.
There's guys in suits all around
the house! Look at this!
Could you stay off the grass?
Get me a sample
and some isotope readings.
They're pulling bushes out
of the ground!
Good Lord! They've got to get
their hands off my bush!
- Drop the bat, ma'am.
- Hey, hey, hey, that's my...
I'm carrying a loaded weapon.
But you'd better get those guys
out of my garden
or I am gonna beat the crap out of them!
Are you experiencing any flu-like
symptoms? Aching joints? Fever?
- No!
- What is this?
How you doing, son?
Is your name Sam?
- Yeah.
- Well, I need you to come with us.
Whoa, way out of line.
Sir, I am asking politely. Back off.
- You're not taking my son.
- Really?
You gonna try to get rough with us?
No, but I'm gonna call the cops
because there's something fishy
going on around here.
Yeah. There's something a little fishy
about you, your son,
your little Taco Bell dog and this
whole operation you got going on here.
- What operation?
- That is what we are gonna find out.
I think direct contact.
- Son?
- Yeah.
- Step forward, please.
- Just stand?
Fourteen rads.
Bingo! Tag them and bag them!
If you hurt my dog, I'll kick your ass!
Get me a sample on
that vegetation ASAP!
Sam! Do not say anything, Sam!
- Yeah.
- Not a word until we get a lawyer!
So,
LadiesMan217.
That is your eBay username, right?
Yeah, but, you know,
it was a typo and I ran with it.
What do you make of this?
My name is Sam Witwicky, okay?
And my...
Is that you?
Yeah, that sounds like LadiesMan.
Last night at the station, you told
the officer your car transformed.
- Enlighten me.
- Well, here's what I said, okay?
'Cause this is a total misunderstanding
that my car had been stolen...
- Really?
- ...from me, from my home,
but it's fine now because it's back!
It came back!
- Well, not by itself.
- Well, no.
Because cars don't do that
because that would be crazy.
That's funny. That is so funny.
So what do you kids know
about aliens, huh?
Oh, you mean, like a Martian?
Like what, E. T? No.
- It's an urban legend.
- Yeah.
You see this?
This is an I-can-do-whatever-I-want
and-get-away-with-it badge.
- Right.
- I'm gonna lock you up forever.
Oh, God. You know what?
Don't listen to him.
He's just pissy 'cause he's got to
get back to guarding the mall.
You, in the training bra, do not test me.
Especially with your daddy's parole
coming up.
What? Parole?
- It's nothing.
- Oh, grand theft auto, that ain't nothing?
You know those cars my dad
used to teach me to fix?
Well, they... They weren't always his.
You stole cars?
Well, we couldn't always afford
a babysitter,
so sometimes he had to take me along.
She's got her own juvie record
to prove it!
She's a criminal. Criminals are hot.
That'd be a real shame if he had to rot
in jail the rest of his natural life.
It is time to talk!
Big! It's big!
Go, go, go, go!
- I can't see it! I can't see it!
- Shift your weight towards the front!
All right! All right!
You A-holes are in trouble now.
Gentlemen, I want to introduce you
to my friend, Optimus Prime.
Taking the children was a bad move.
Autobots, relieve them of their weapons.
Freeze!
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Give me those!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Hi, there.
You don't seem afraid.
Are you not surprised to see us?
Look, there are
Seven protocols, okay?
I'm not authorized
to communicate with you
except to tell you
I can't communicate with you.
- Get out of the car.
- All right.
- Me? You want me to get...
- Now!
All right, all right. Get out. Hey.
All right, I'm... I'm getting out.
I'm getting out. You see?
Very nifty how you put us down
without really killing us.
You're good with handcuffs, too,
now, huh?
How you doing?
- You weren't supposed to hear all that.
- How's it going, huh?
- Yeah.
- This is real.
Now, listen. If I choose to engage
with him, mum is the word, all right?
Sam, I have a record
because I wouldn't turn my dad in.
When have you had to sacrifice
anything in your perfect little life?
Big guys. Big guys with big guns, huh?
What is Sector Seven? Answer me.
I'm the one who asks questions
around here. Not you, young man!
- How'd you know about the aliens?
- Where did you take my parents?
- I am not at liberty to discuss it.
- No?
Hey. You touch me,
that's a federal offense.
Do-whatever-you-want
and-get-away-with-it badge, right?
Yeah. Brave now all of a sudden, with
his big alien friend standing over there.
- Where is Sector Seven?
- Wouldn't you like to know?
Hey!
Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man.
Get that thing to stop, huh?
- All right, tough guy, take it off.
- What are you talking about?
- Your clothes, all of it, off.
- For what?
For threatening my dad.
Little lady, this is the beginning
of the end of your life.
You're a criminal.
Let's face facts. It's in your gene pool.
Those are nice.
Now get behind the pole.
All right.
This is such a felony, what you're doing.
- I will hunt you down, okay?
- He'll hunt you down.
- Without any remorse!
- No remorse.
- Enjoy.
- Okay?
- We have got to alert everyone.
- They already know. Speaker.
Optimus! Incoming!
Roll out.
Okay, I'm picking up rad readings
under that bridge right down there.
Okay, I'm getting really good rad
readings. Forty-two and higher.
Up you get.
Okay, we're dropping in.
Really strong readings right down
below us. There he is.
Ship one and two, come on in.
That's it, right there.
Mark him, mark him.
Okay, there he is. 11:30. 11:30.
Right off the nose.
I got it. 12:00.
Okay, I'm tracking him. I've got him.
Got him going down the street.
Okay. Where'd he go, guys? I lost him.
Got no IR signature. Where'd he go?
Okay, I lost him. I lost him.
Okay, we're coming around.
Easy, you two.
No! No! No, Sam! Sam, don't drop me!
Sam, don't! Sam, don't! I'm slipping!
I'm slipping!
- Hold on!
- No!
Sam!
All right, we've got him pinned.
We've got him pinned in the river.
I'm in for the shot.
Stop! Stop!
Wait! No!
- Take the shot, get him.
- Take the shot.
No!
No! Stop!
Stop!
Get down on the ground! Get down!
Get down!
What? Okay.
Look, he's not fighting back!
Freeze it! Freeze it! Freeze it!
Stop hurting him!
Don't let him move!
I got him here!
No!
Happy to see me again?
Put him in a car
with his little criminal friend.
I want that thing frozen
and ready for transport!
Hang back. Let me check it out.
Optimus,
are we just gonna stand here
and do nothing?
There's no way to free Bumblebee
without harming the humans.
- But it's not right. He...
- Let them leave.
The Chinese and the Russians
are nearing our area of operations
in the western Pacific.
We feel like this could get
out of hand real fast.
But the next couple of hours
may just define his presidency.
US and Chinese task forces
approaching 100 nautical miles
of cruise missile range.
Tell the strike group commander that
he's not to engage unless fired on first.
- Yes, sir!
- Mr. Secretary?
Tom Banachek. I'm with Sector Seven,
Advanced Research Division.
Never heard of it. I'm a little busy, Tom.
I think you can see that.
- What's going on here?
- I don't know.
Sit rep! Talk to me!
- The whole room's gone down, sir.
- I can see that!
The virus was coded to shut us down.
- General?
- I'll take a seat.
What do you mean, "shut us down"?
They used our network to spread out
to the whole world.
The blackout's global.
We have no communications,
satellite and land lines are dead.
You mean to tell me that I cannot pick
up this telephone and call my family?
Mr. Secretary? I'm here under
direct order from the President.
You really need to see
what I have in the case.
You'll have to accept that
there are certain things
you won't understand right away.
Sector Seven is a special-access
division of the government
convened in secret under
President Hoover 80 years ago.
You may remember NASA JPL
lost the Beagle 2 Mars Rover.
We told them to report the mission
a complete failure. It wasn't.
Beagle 2 transmitted 13 seconds.
This was classified above top secret.
EDA ended at 170 hours, 48 minutes.
More than just a pile of Martian rocks.
This is the image from Mars.
Here's the image your
Special Ops team was able to retrieve
from the base attack.
We believe they are of
the same exoskeletal type,
and obviously not Russian
or North Korean.
Are we talking about an invasion?
We intercepted the message
from your Special Ops team.
These things can be hurt by
our weapons and now they know it.
That's why the virus shut us down,
so we can't coordinate against
their next attack,
which I would bet my ridiculous
government salary is coming soon.
Get word to our fleet commanders
over the National Guard frequency.
It's a shortwave radio channel.
It might be still working.
Tell them to turn their ships around
and come home. ASAP!
And inform all commands to prepare
for imminent attack.
Captain Lennox, we need you and
your team to come with us right now!
Let's go!
She's in here.
What's going on?
You're coming with me.
- You're going to be my advisor.
- Me, too?
Who's this?
- He's my advisor.
- He comes, too.
- So...
- What'd they get you for?
I bought a car.
Turned out to be an alien robot.
Wow.
Who knew?
Make a hole! Watch your back!
Please, let this work.
Fire it up, Optimus.
The code.
The code on these glasses indicates
the All Spark is 230 miles from here.
I sense the Decepticons
are getting ready to mobilize.
They must know it's here, as well.
What about Bumblebee?
We can't just leave him to die
and become some human experiment!
He'll die in vain
if we don't accomplish our mission.
Bumblebee is a brave soldier.
This is what he would want.
Why are we fighting to save
the humans?
They're a primitive and violent race.
Were we so different?
They're a young species.
They have much to learn.
But I've seen goodness in them.
Freedom is the right of
all sentient beings.
You all know there's only one way
to end this war.
We must destroy the Cube.
If all else fails, I will unite it
with the spark in my chest.
That's suicide.
The Cube is raw power.
It could destroy you both.
A necessary sacrifice to bring peace
to this planet.
We cannot let the humans pay
for our mistakes.
It's been an honor serving with you all.
- Autobots, roll out!
- We rolling!
Team attention! Present arms!
At ease. Captain, Sergeant.
Got your intel. Excellent work.
Thank you, sir.
What about the gunships?
They're being retrofitted
with sabot rounds now.
If they hit us again,
we'll be ready for them.
But it won't do us much good if we can't
get world communications back up.
Hey, kid.
I think we got off to a bad start, huh?
You must be hungry?
You want a latte? HoHo?
Double venti macchiato?
Where's my car?
Son, I need you to listen to me
very carefully.
People can die here.
We need to know everything you know.
We need to know it now.
Okay.
But first, I'll take my car, my parents.
Maybe you should write that down.
Oh, and her juvie record.
That's got to be gone. Like, forever.
Come with me.
We'll talk about your car.
Thank you.
The man's an extortionist.
All right, here's the situation.
You've all had direct contact
with the NBEs.
NBEs?
Non-Biological Extraterrestrials.
Try and keep up with the acronyms.
What you're about to see
is totally classified.
Dear God. What is this?
We think when he made his approach
over the north pole,
our gravitational field screwed up
his telemetry.
He crashed in the ice,
probably a few thousand years ago.
We shipped him here to this facility
in 1934.
We call him NBE One.
Well, sir, I don't mean to correct you
on everything you think you know,
but, I mean, that's Megatron.
He's the leader of the Decepticons.
He's been in cryostasis since 1935.
Your great-great-grandfather made
one of the greatest discoveries
in the history of mankind.
Fact is, you're looking at
the source of the modern age,
the microchip, lasers, spaceflight, cars,
all reverse-engineered by studying him.
NBE One. That's what we call it.
And you didn't think the United States
military might need to know
that you're keeping a hostile alien robot
frozen in the basement?
Until these events, we had no
credible threat to national security.
Well, you got one now.
- So why Earth?
- It's the All Spark.
All Spark? What is that?
Well, yeah, they came here looking
for some sort of cube-looking thing.
Anyway, Mr. NBE One here, AKA
Megatron, that's what they call him,
who's pretty much the harbinger
of death, wants to use the Cube
to transform human technology
to take over the universe.
That's their plan.
- And you're sure about that?
- Yeah.
You guys know where it is, don't you?
Follow me.
You're about to see our crown jewel.
Carbon dating puts the Cube here
around 10,000 BC.
The first Seven didn't find it until 1913.
They knew it was alien because of
the matching hieroglyphics on the Cube
as well as NBE One.
President Hoover had the dam built
around it.
Four football fields thick of concrete.
A perfect way to hide its energy
from being detected by anyone
or any alien species on the outside.
Wait, back up. You said
the dam hides the Cube's energy.
- What kind exactly?
- Good question.
Please step inside.
They have to lock us in.
Oh, wow.
What's that? Freddy Krueger done
been up in here or something?
Oh, no, man.
Freddy Krueger have four blades, man.
That's only three. That's Wolverine!
- Right? That's Wolverine!
- That's very funny.
Anybody have any mechanical devices?
BlackBerry? Key alarm? Cell phone?
I got a phone.
Nokias are real nasty.
You've got to respect the Japanese.
They know the way of the samurai.
Nokia's from Finland.
Yes, but he's, you know, a little strange.
He's a little strange.
We're able to take the Cube radiation
and funnel it into that box.
- Mean little sucker, huh?
- That thing is freaky!
Kind of like the itty-bitty
Energizer Bunny from hell, huh?
He's breaking the box.
Go! Go! Go!
Move!
Gentlemen, they know the Cube is here.
Banachek. What's going on?
Well, the NBE One hangar
has lost power...
- What?
- ... and the backup generator
- is just not gonna cut it.
- Do you have an arms room?
Megatron! Megatron! Megatron!
I'll bring security to the...
Get everyone to
the NBE One chamber now!
- The lights are out!
- Move it! Move it!
Let's go!
They're popping our generators!
Megatron melting!
16502. We're losing pressure.
Stand by! Set!
We're losing pressure!
The cryogenic system is failing!
We're losing NBE One!
Forty millimeter sabot rounds
on that table!
That's good. Get all the ammo you got.
Everything you can carry. Bring it.
You got to take me to my car.
You have to take me to my car.
He's gonna know what to do
with the Cube.
- Your car? It's confiscated.
- Then unconfiscate it.
We do not know what will happen
if we let it near this thing!
- You don't know.
- Maybe you know, but I don't know.
You just wanna sit here and wait
and see what happens?
I have people's lives at stake here,
young man.
Take him to his car!
Drop it.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Drop your weapon, soldier.
There's an alien war going on
and you're gonna shoot me?
You know, we didn't ask to be here.
I'm ordering you under S-Seven
executive jurisdiction.
Seven don't exist.
Right. And we don't take orders
from people that don't exist.
- I'm gonna count to five. Okay.
- Well, I'm gonna count to three.
- Simmons?
- Yes, sir?
I'd do what he says. Losing's really
not an option for these guys.
All right. Okay.
Hey, you want to lay the fate of the
world on the kid's Camaro? That's cool.
No, no!
Stop! You got to stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
No, no, stop, stop, stop!
Let him go! Let him go!
Are you okay?
They didn't hurt you, right?
Listen to me. The Cube is here
and the Decepticons are coming.
No, no, don't worry about them.
They're okay. Right?
They're not gonna hurt you.
Just back up a little bit.
He's friendly. He's fine.
Okay, come on. Put the guns down.
They're not gonna hurt you.
Here, come with me.
I'm gonna take you to the All Spark.
Okay, here we go. He doing something.
He doing something.
Oh, my God.
Message from Starfleet, Captain.
Let's get to it.
He's right. We stay here, we're screwed
with Megatron in the other hangar.
Mission City is 22 miles away.
We're gonna sneak that Cube
out of here
and we're gonna hide it somewhere
in the city.
Good! Right.
But we cannot make a stand
without the Air Force.
This place must have some kind
of radio link!
- Yes. Shortwave, CB.
- Right, yes.
Sir, you got to figure out some way
to get word out to them. Let's move!
In the alien archive, sir!
- The alien...
- There's an old Army radio console.
- Will it work?
- Anything's possible!
- Did you see that...
- All right, Sam, get it in the car!
Mr. Secretary! Get our birds in the air.
When we get to the city,
we're gonna find a radio,
and I'll have Epps vector them in, okay?
Affirmative!
Warning! NBE One
cryo-containment failing.
Check that backup system!
The cryo's failing! You got to bump up
the cryo! The cryo's failing!
Come on! Get out of here!
Heads up! Look out!
Set a perimeter around
the yellow vehicle!
- This way, this way, this way!
- Up there! Let's go!
I am Megatron!
- The Cube's okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.
Well, put the seat belt on.
Pour it on him!
I live to serve you, Lord Megatron.
Where is the Cube?
The humans have taken it.
You fail me yet again, Starscream.
Get them!
Come on, Mags!
Over here, sir!
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.
Come to me, Maxwell, come to me.
Plugged in there.
- We're hot! We're live!
- Where are the mikes?
Mikes?
This doesn't work without mikes,
Simmons.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Let's find them.
Kid, get in the chair!
Just get in the chair, all right?
- Okay, I'll sit. I'll sit.
- They steal everything out of this place.
How do we get the signal out?
How do we call the Air Force?
- Glen?
- Huh?
Can you hotwire this computer to
transmit a tone through the radio?
What good is that?
Morse code! You can use this
to transmit it through that!
Okay, I'll do it! Turn it around.
Okay, let's see.
Simmons, I need a screwdriver!
There's Optimus.
Almost done.
What the hell was that?
Barricade the door!
- Get something.
- Watch out!
Six, five, four, six, three.
Here! Put some rounds in!
Master search.
I got it! We're transmitting!
Send exactly what I say!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Burn, you little sucker! Burn!
"This is Defense Secretary Keller.
Get me NORTHCOM commander."
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
What was that?
Authenticate emergency action.
Blackbird 1195...
Sir, I have an authenticated
air strike order from Sec Def.
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?
It's the same cop!
Block them, block them, block them.
Oh, my God.
Cool, Mom!
This is so not good.
He's behind the pillar!
- Shoot that mother...
- Maggie, cover fire!
It's the Air Force! They're responding!
Sucker, burn!
Oh, shit!
Yes! They're sending F-22s to the city!
Raptors, let's scramble,
scramble, scramble.
Strike and Dark Star roll call.
Looking out the right side.
Push to Kill Box One Alpha...
- Come on, let's go! Mount up!
- Move out! Move out! Go! Go!
Here, I got shortwave radios.
Wait. What am I supposed to
do with these?
Well, use them! It's all we got!
This is like RadioShack dinosaur radios
or something, man.
I'm only gonna get 20 or 30 miles
out of these things.
Are there any aircraft orbiting the city?
F-22 at 12:00.
All right, I want planes for air cover
and get Black Hawks on station
to extract that Cube. You got it?
Air Force has arrived! Pop smoke!
Raptor, Raptor, do you copy?
We have you visual.
Green smoke is the mark.
Provide air cover and vector
Black Hawks for extraction.
It's Starscream!
Please tell me you copy.
Back up! Take cover! Bumblebee!
No, no, no, no, no! Move!
- Back up! Back up!
- Retreat! Fall back!
Incoming!
Anybody hurt? Everyone okay?
Clear the area!
Oh, my God.
Bumblebee? No. Your legs!
Your legs.
Here. Here, back, back, back, back!
You all right?
Please get up. Bumblebee? Get up!
Ratchet!
- What the hell was that?
- What are you talking about?
What do you mean, what am
I talking about? They shot at us!
F-22 pilots would never fly
below buildings.
That's alien. That ain't friendly!
You got to get up. You're okay.
You're okay.
Come on!
Army Black Hawk inbound
to your location. Over.
Alpha 273 degrees, 10 miles.
November Victor, 1.2 clicks north.
Move out! Let's go!
Let's go! Move!
I'm not gonna leave you.
Come on, Decepticon punk!
Oh, my God!
Concentrate your fire!
Come on. Come on.
Megatron!
It's Megatron! Retreat! Move! Fall back!
Fall back!
Get our guys out of the way!
Get out of here! Go!
Get them out of the buggy! Move out!
We need air cover down here now!
Sam, help me with this.
- That all you got, Megatron?
- Come here, little cretin.
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece?
No! I want two!
What's going on?
Sir! That tank thing's getting back up.
Oh, these things just don't die.
Oh, we're so dead.
- Wrap it around the head.
- Sam!
Where's the Cube?
- Right there.
- Okay.
And take that and wrap it around
the base and then put it
around his neck.
- Okay?
- Epps, get those Black Hawks here!
That building.
- Okay.
- What?
All right, I can't leave my guys back
there, so here, take this flare.
Okay, there's a tall, white building
with statues on top.
- Go to the roof. Set the flare.
- No.
- Signal the chopper and set the flare.
- No, no. I can't do this!
Listen to me! You're a soldier now!
All right? I need you to take this Cube.
Get it into military hands
while we hold them off,
or a lot of people are gonna die.
- You got to go. You got to go.
- No, I'm not leaving.
- You need to go. Go.
- No, I'm not leaving
till I get Bumblebee out of here, okay?
Army Black Hawk requested.
Immediate evac for civilian boy
with precious cargo.
Headed to rooftop marked by flare.
- Sam, we will protect you.
- Okay.
- Epps, where are those planes?
- Sam!
No matter what happens,
I'm really glad I got in that car with you.
Sam! Get to the building! Move!
- Decepticons, attack!
- Hit it!
- Cover fire!
- Move to cover!
Watch out!
- Girl, get that tow truck out of here!
- I'm going! I'm going!
Get out of here now!
Megatron!
Prime.
Humans don't deserve to live.
They deserve to choose for themselves.
Then you will die with them!
Join them in extinction!
Keep moving, Sam!
Don't stop!
No!
Sam, get to the building!
Give me that Cube, boy!
Did that jerk just dent my car?
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me!
I smell you, boy!
Maggot!
Oh, no!
I'll drive! You shoot!
This isn't going well!
Shoot! Shoot!
Nice shot.
- That tank is definitely dead now.
- All right, let's go! We got business!
Hey!
Hey! I'm over here!
We've got the boy.
Watch out!
Missile!
Hang on, Sam!
No! No!
Is it fear or courage
that compels you, fleshling?
Where do I go?
Give me the All Spark
and you may live to be my pet.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm never giving you this All Spark!
Oh, so unwise.
I got you, boy.
Hold on to the Cube!
- Oh, no. Oh, no!
- Disgusting.
Sam?
You risked your life to protect the Cube.
No sacrifice,
- no victory.
- If I cannot defeat Megatron,
you must push the Cube into my chest.
I will sacrifice myself to destroy it.
Get behind me.
It's you and me, Megatron.
No, it's just me, Prime.
At the end of this day,
one shall stand, one shall fall.
You still fight for the weak!
That is why you lose!
Fighter jets in 60 seconds.
We got friendlies mixed with bad guys.
Targets will be marked.
Hey.
Bring the rain. All right?
All right, let's kill these things.
- Move, move, move!
- Remember, aim low.
Armor's weak under the chest.
Target marked. Still waiting.
Time on target, 20 seconds.
F-22s, we're still waiting.
Move out!
Incoming!
Weapons armed. Status green.
Run! Move!
Second wave's on approach.
What is that? Break off!
- Copy.
- It's either a massive amount of...
Two, get a lock! Pop that guy!
Stay on him. Keep him in your sights.
Take him out!
Two's down!
I'll kill you!
Mine! All Spark!
Sam! Put the Cube in my chest! Now!
Sam!
No, Sam!
Hold up.
You left me no choice, brother.
Sam, I owe you my life.
We are in your debt.
Prime, we couldn't save him.
Jazz.
We lost a great comrade
but gained new ones.
Thank you, all of you.
You honor us with your bravery.
Permission to speak, sir?
Permission granted, old friend.
You speak now?
I wish to stay with the boy.
If that is his choice.
Yes.
Gentlemen, the President has ordered
Sector Seven be terminated
and the remains of the dead aliens
disposed of.
The Laurentian Abyss is
seven miles below sea level,
deepest place on our planet.
The massive depth and pressure there,
coupled with subfreezing temperatures,
would crush and entomb them,
leaving no evidence.
With the All Spark gone,
we cannot return life to our planet.
And fate has yielded its reward,
a new world to call home.
We live among its people now,
hiding in plain sight,
but watching over them in secret,
waiting, protecting.
I have witnessed
their capacity for courage.
And though we are worlds apart,
like us, there's more to them
than meets the eye.
I am Optimus Prime
and I send this message
to any surviving Autobots
taking refuge among the stars.
We are here.
We are waiting.
Can you shed any light on the recent,
so-called alien activity in the area?
Do you know what? I think that
if there was some sort of an alien
- infestation...
- Yeah.
They, the government,
would be the first to let you know.
The government would let us know.
- I mean, this is America.
- Yeah.
You know, that's how we know
we live in a free land,
because there's no secrets.
They'd say, "Hey! Duck and cover."
Your head is kind of a different size
than it is on television.

[ Bell Clanging ]
Hi, babe.
- I have something for you.
- What is it?
-Just a little something.
- [ Laughing ]
Here you go.
Oh.Johnny, it's beautiful.
Thank you.
- You wait right here.
- Mmm.
- I'm gonna try it on right now.
- Mm-hmm.
[Johnny ]
Wow. You look so sexy, Lisa.
- Isn't it fabulous?
- I would do anything for my girl.
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, Denny.
- Wow. Look at you.
- It's from Johnny.
Anything for my princess.
[ Laughing ]
- How much was it?
- Denny, don't ask a question like that.
Nice to see you, Denny.
I'm going to take a nap.
- Can I go upstairs too?
- [ Laughs ]
- Denny, I think I'm gonna join him.
- [ Laughs ]
[ Lisa ]
I've got some candles upstairs.
You always think.
[ Laughs ]
All right. I'm ready.
[ Lisa ] This is so great.
I can't wait for you to get it off of me.
- [ Laughing ]
- [Johnny ] Oh,yeah.
- You're in for it.
- Oh,yeah.
How much you pay
for this dress?
Don't even ask.
[ Laughing ]
Ooh.
- Ouch.
- [Johnny Continues Laughing ]
- [ All Laughing ]
- [ Denny ] Stop.
Stop. No, stop.
Get up.
Denny, do you have
something else to do?
I just like
to watch you guys.
Oh, Denny, Denny.
Denny boy.
Denny, two's great,
but three is a crowd.
- I get it. You guys wanna be alone.
- That's the idea.
Fine. I have homework
to do anyway.
Bye, lovebirds.
- Bye, Denny.
- Bye, Denny.

- Mm-mmm. I have to go now.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hi, Mom. How are you?
I'm fine. How are you?
Hmm?
Okay. Let's go to the couch.
And we will sit down.
Now...
what's happening with you?
- Hmm?
- Nothin' much. Do you want some coffee?
What's wrong? Tell me.
I'm not feeling good today.
Well, why not?
I don't love him anymore.
Why don't you love him anymore?
Tell me.
He's so... boring.
You've known him
for over five years.
You're engaged.
You said you loved him.
He supports you.
He provides for you.
And, darling,
you can't support yourself.
He's a wonderful man,
and he loves you very much.
And his position is very secure.
And he told me
he plans to buy you a house.
That's why he's so boring.
- Well, what are you going to do?
- I don't know.
I don't mind living with him.
Well, you can't do that.
Have you talked to him about it?
No.
- I don't know what to do.
- He's a wonderful person.
And he's getting a promotion
very soon.
He bought you a car.
He bought you a ring, clothes-
whatever you wanted.
Now you wanna dump him.
That's not right.
I've always thought of him
as my son-in-law.
You should marryJohnny.
He would be good for you.
- I guess you're right about that.
- Of course I'm right.
I know men.
I wasn't born yesterday.
I'm glad you're listening
to your mother.
Nobody else listens to me.
You're probably right
about that, Mom.
Well, I'm glad you're
listening to your mother.
Listen, I've gotta go.
But you remember
what I told you, okay?
Mm-hmm.
- Bye-bye, now.
- [ Door Opens ]
[ Door Closes ]
Thanks, Mom.
[ Beeping, Line Ringing ]
- Hello?
- Hey, baby. How you doin'?
Oh, hey. How you doin'?
Yeah, I'm very busy. What's goin' on?
I just finished talking
to my mom.
She gave me this big lecture
aboutJohnny.
- We'll talk about it later. I told you I'm very busy.
- We'll talk about it now.
Whenever you say
we'll talk about it later, we never do.
I can't wait till later.
I wanna talk right now.
You owe me one anyway.
Okay. All right, what do you
want to talk about?
She's a stupid bitch.
She wants to control my life.
I'm not gonna put up with that.
I'm gonna do what I wanna do,
and that's it.
What do you think I should do?
Why do you ask me? You've been
very happy with Johnny.
What do you want me to say?
You should enjoy your life.
What's the problem?
Maybe you're right.
Can I see you tomorrow?
Okay. All right.
How about noon?
- I'll be waiting for you. Bye.
- All right, see ya.

I like you very much,
lover boy.
What are you doin' this for?
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?
I'm your girl.
Johnny's my best friend.
- You're gonna be married next month. Come on.
- [ Sighs ]
Forget... aboutJohnny.
This is between you... and me.
I don't think so.
I-I'm leaving now.
Please don't leave.
Please don't leave.
I need you. I love you.
I don't wanna get married anymore.
I don't loveJohnny.

God. Why did you do this to me?
[ Sighs ]
Why?
Johnny's my best friend.
Didn't you enjoy it?
That's not the point.
I love you, Mark.
Look, you're very attractive.
All right? You're beautiful.
But we can't do this anymore.
I can't hurtJohnny.
I know.
He's your best friend.
Hey. This'll be our secret.
Mmm.
- Hi.
- [ Woman ] Can I help you?
Yeah. Can I have
a dozen red roses, please?
Oh, hi,Johnny.
I didn't know it was you.
- Here you go.
- That's me. How much is it?
- It'll be $1 8.
- Here you go. Keep the change.
- Hi, doggy.
- You're my favorite customer.
- Thanks a lot. Bye.
- Bye-bye.
Yeah. Deliver it.
Yeah. Deliver it.

half artichoke with pesto,
and light on the cheese.
- Thanks.
- [ Beeps ]
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- Who is it?
Denny.
Denny.
- Hey, Denny. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. What's new?
Actually, I'm really busy.
Do you want something to drink?
No, thanks.
I just wanna talk toJohnny.
You look beautiful today.
- Can I kiss you?
- You are such a little brat.
I'm just kidding.
I love you and Johnny.
Okay, okay.Johnny's gonna
be here any minute.
- You can wait if you want.
- Mm, I gotta go.
- You'll tell him I stopped by.
- Of course I will.
- Bye.
- Bye, Denny.
Hi, babe.
These are for you.
Thanks, honey.
They're beautiful.
- Did you get your promotion?
- Nah.
You didn't get it, did you?
That son of a bitch told me
that I would get it within three months.
I saved them bundles. They're crazy.
I don't think I will ever get it.
They betrayed me.
They didn't keep their promise.
They tricked me,
and I don't care anymore.
Did you tell them
how much you save them?
Of course. What do you think?
They already put my ideas into practice.
The bank saves money,
and they are using me. And I am the fool.
I still love you.
- You're the only one who does.
- At least you have friends.
I didn't get any calls today.
You're right. The computer business
is too competitive.
Do you want me
to order a pizza?
- Whatever. I don't care.
- I already ordered a pizza.
[ Chuckling ]
You think about everything.
What's the matter?
You all right?
It's just a lousy promotion.
You know what you need?
You need a drink.
I don't drink.
You know that.
[ Chuckles ]
Don't worry about it.
It's good for you.
You must be crazy.
I can't drink this.
If you love me,
you'll drink this.
[ Chuckles ]
You're right. It tastes good.
I know. I am right.
Don't worry about those fuckers.
You're a good man.
Drink, and let's have some fun.

So, I'm organizing a party
forJohnny's birthday.
- Can you come?
- [ Mother ] When is it?
Next Friday at 6:00.
It's a surprise.
- Oh.
- You can bring someone if you want.
Well, sure, I can come,
but I don't know if I'll bring anybody.
Oh, that jerk, Harold.
He wants me to give him
a share of my house.
That house belongs to me.
He has no right.
I am not giving him a penny.
- Who does he think he is?
- He's your brother.
He is always bugging me
about my house.
Fifteen years ago, we agreed
that house belongs to me.
Now the value of the house is going up,
and he's seeing dollar signs.
Everything goes wrong at once.
- Nobody wants to help me, and I'm dying.
- You're not dying, Mom.
I got the results of the test back.
I definitely have breast cancer.
Look, don't worry about it.
Everything will be fine.
- Mm.
- They're curing lots of people every day.
I'm sure I'll be all right.
Oh. I heard Edward
is talking about me.
He is a hateful man.
Oh, I'm so glad I divorced him.
Look, don't worry about it.
You just concentrate on getting well.
Well, at least you have a good man.
You're wrong.
Mom, he's not what you think he is.
He didn't get his promotion,
and he got drunk last night.
And he hit me.
Johnny doesn't drink.
What are you talking about?
He did last night,
and I don't love him anymore.
Johnny is your financial security.
You can't afford to ignore this.
Yeah, okay, Mom.
Can I just talk to you later?
You don't want to talk to me.
I just got done
talking with a client...
and I have to get ready
to meet him.
- Can I just talk to you later?
- Okay.
I will see you later.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
How much time do we have?
- I don't know. Uh, couple hours.
- [ Chuckling ]
At least.
Well, let's have some fun.
Did you, uh, know...
that chocolate
is the symbol of love?
[ Chuckling ]
Feed me.
Yum.
- That's delicious.
- [ Chuckling ]
Arms up.
Chocolate is a symbol of love.
- [ Door Opens ]
- Hello?
- [ Door Opens ]
- Hello?
- [ Lisa Laughing ]
- What are these characters doing here?
- They like to come here to do their homework.
- What homework?
Mom, this is Michelle's boyfriend, Mike.
Mike, this is my mother.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Mm.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
[ Sighs ]
All that shopping wore me out.
- Hey, Lisa.
- Hey, Denny.
Denny, this is my mom.
Mom, this is Denny.
How many people come in
and out of this apartment every day?
This is worse
than Grand Central Station.
- I just need to borrow some sugar.
- Help yourself,Denny.
I also need a cup of flour
and a half a stick of butter.
- Doesn't your home have a kitchen?
- I'll come back later.
[ Door Closes ]
- Tell me, what does Denny do?
-Johnny wanted to adopt Denny.
It's really a tragedy how many kids
out there don't have parents.
When Denny turned 1 8,Johnny found him
a little apartment in this building...
and he's paying for it
until he graduates from school.
Johnny really loves Denny
even though he doesn't say it much.
He's, like, a father figure to him.
I told you, Mom.Johnny is very caring
about the people in his life.
And he gave Denny
his own set of keys to our place.
Please, don't hurtJohnny.
Now, if you really don't love him, so be it.
But you should tell him.
I forgot my, uh, book.
Oh! What-What's this?
- [ Both Laughing ]
- Oh. That's-That's nothing. Really.
- [ Laughing ]
- Homework. [ Sighs ]
Don't worry about it.
If I were a burglar,
you would be my best friend.
Look, I don't wanna
talk about it.
You know I worry about you.
- Oh. I have to go home.
- Okay, Mom.
- Bye-bye.
- [ Mouths Words ]
- [ Door Opens, Closes ]
- [ Sighs ]
Oh, my God.
Hey, Denny.
Chris-R.
I've been lookin' for you.
Yeah, sure you have.
You have my money, right?
Yeah. It's comin'.
It'll be here in a few minutes.
[ Basketball Bouncing ]
What do you mean
it's coming, Denny?
Where's... my money?
Okay.Just-
Just give me five minutes.
-Just give me five.
- Five minutes?
You want
five fuckin' minutes, Denny?
You know what?
I haven't got five fucking minutes!
[ Crying, Whimpering ]
I'm gonna ask you again, Denny.
- Where's my money?
- I don't have anything.
- Where's my money, Denny?
- [ Whimpering Continues ]
Where's my fucking money, Denny?
- What did you do with my fucking money?
- I swear to God. It's coming.
- Where's my fuckin' money, Denny?
- Put the gun down.!
My fucking money.!
Where's my fucking money, Denny?
What's with this guy?
Get off!.
- [ Shouting ]
- You're fuckin' dead, Denny!
- What's going on here? Somebody help!
- [ Shouting Continues ]
- Let's take him to the police.
- You're fucking dead!
Denny. Are you okay?
- What did that man want from you?
- Nothing.
Oh, that was not nothing.
- Tell me everything.
- You have no idea what kind of
trouble you're in here, do you?
- I owe him some money.
- What kind of money?
- I owe him some money.
- What kind of money?
- Everything is okay. He's gone.
- Everything is not okay.
- Denny, that is a dangerous man.
- [ Sobbing ]
Just calm down.
He's going to jail.
- Denny, what kind of money? Just tell me!
- What do you need money for?
Mom, please!
Denny's with me and Johnny!
A man like that, with a gun.
My God!
Denny, look at me in the eyes
and tell me the truth.
- We're your friends.
- I bought some drugs off of him.
- [ Mouthing Words ]
- Things got mixed up.
I didn't mean this to happen.
- [ Sobbing ] Denny!
- And I don't have them anymore.
- What kind of drugs, Denny?
- It doesn't matter. I don't have them anymore.
It doesn't matter? How in the hell
did you get involved with drugs?
Were you giving them to him?
Selling them to him?
-Where in the hell did you meet that man?
-What kind of drugs do you take?
- It's nothing like that.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
I just needed some money
to pay off some stuff.
How much do you
have to give him?
- This is not the way you make money.
- How much?
Stop ganging up on me!
Well, it is time somebody
ganged up on you. For God's sake!
A man like that! Where in the hell
did you meet a man like that?
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters a great deal.
A man holds a gun on you. You almost got killed.
You expect me to forget that?
You're not my fucking mother!
- You listen to me, little boy!
- No, no! No, don't!
Somebody had better
do something around here.
- [ Crying ]
- It's okay.
Are you okay, Denny?
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Are you okay?
What's okay?
He's taking drugs.
- Come on, stop. It was a mistake.
- A mistake. That he takes drugs.
- Let's go home.
- Come on. It's clear.
- What's clear? I am going to call the police.
- Mom, stop.
- It was Denny's mistake.Just stop.
- Let's go.
- Why did you do this? You know better, right?
- I'm sorry.
- Why?
- I'm sorry.
You know better, Denny.
You almost got killed.
- I'm sorry.
- [ Sighs ]
It won't happen again. I promise.
Denny, you know thatJohnny's
like your father.
And we're your friends.
We're gonna help you.
Let's go home.
[ Lisa ]
I miss you.
[ Lisa ]
I miss you.
I just saw you.
What are you talking about?
I just wanted to hear
your sexy voice.
I keep thinking about
your strong hands around my body.
It excites me so much.
I love you.
Is Johnny there?
He's... in the shower.
I don't understand you.
Why do you do things like this?
Because I love you.
You just don't care, do you?
No, I do care.
But we agreed.
It's over between us.
I understand.
It's our secret.
But I still have feelings for you.
- You just don't care.
- I do care.
I have to go now.
I'll see you later, darling.
- Don't call me that.
- Okay. Bye.
[ Phone Beeps ]
I did not hit her.
It's not true.
I did not hit her.
It's not true.
It's bullshit!
I did not hit her. I did not.
Oh, hi, Mark.
- Hey,Johnny. What's up?
- I have a problem with Lisa.
- She said that I hit her.
- [ Sighs ] What?
- Well, did you?
- No. It's not true. Don't even ask.
- What's new with you?
- I'm just sittin' up here thinkin', you know.
- I got a question for you.
- Yeah?
You think girls
like to cheat like guys do?
What makes you say that?
I don't know.
I'm just- I'm just thinkin'.
I don't have to worry about that,
because Lisa's loyal to me.
Yeah, man, you never know.
People are very strange these days.
I used to know a girl.
She had a dozen guys.
One of'em found out, beat her up so bad
she ended up in a hospital on Guerrero Street.
[ Laughing ]
What a story, Mark.
You can say that again.
I'm so happy I have you as my best friend,
and I love Lisa so much.
Yeah, man.
Yeah, you are very lucky.
Maybe you should have a girl, Mark.
Yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe I have one already.
I don't know yet.
What happened?
Remember Betty? That's her name?
- Betty?
- Yeah.
Yeah, we don't
see each other anymore.
She wasn't any good in bed. She was beautiful,
but we had too many arguments.
That's too bad.
My Lisa is great when I can get it.
Aw, man.
I just can't figure women out.
Sometimes they're just too smart.
Sometimes they're flat-out stupid.
Other times they're just evil.
It seems to me
like you're the expert, Mark.
No, definitely not an expert,Johnny.
What's bothering you, Mark?
- Nothin', man.
- Do you have some secrets?
- Forget it. Forget it, dude.
- Why don't you tell me?
- Is it some secret? Tell me.
- Forget it. I'll talk to you later.
Well, whatever.
- Hey,Johnny.
- Hi, Denny.
- What's wrong with Mark?
- He's cranky today. [ Laughing ]
Girl trouble, I guess.
- What's new with you?
- Not much.
- Still goin' to the movie tonight?
- Oh, sure. We are.
What kind of movie
are we gonna see?
Well, we'll see-
[ Clicks Tongue ]
Denny, don't plan too much.
It may not come out right.
All right.
Let's toss the ball around.
Okay.
Gotta tell you about somethin'.
Shoot, Denny.
- It's about Lisa.
- Go on.
She's beautiful.
She looks great in her red dress.
- I think I'm in love with her.
- Go on.
I know she doesn't like me,
because sometimes she's mean to me.
But sometimes,
when I'm around her...
I feel like wantin' to kiss her
and tell her that I love her.
I don't know.
I'm just confused.
[ Clicks Tongue ]
Denny, don't worry about that.
Lisa loves you, too, as a person...
as a human being, as a friend.
You know,
people don't have to say it.
They can feel it.
What do you mean?
You can love someone
deep inside your heart...
and there is nothing
wrong with it.
If a lot of people
loved each other...
the world would be
a better place to live.
- Lisa's your future wife.
- Denny, don't worry about it.
You are part of our family,
and we love you very much.
And we'll help you anytime.
And Lisa loves you, too,
as a friend.
You are sort of like her son.
You mean you're not upset
with me?
No, because I trust you,
and I trust Lisa.
- What about Elizabeth, huh?
- Well-
- I love her.
- Mm-hmm.
When I graduate from college,
get a good job...
I wanna marry her
and have kids with her.
- That's the idea.
- You're right.
Thanks for paying my tuition.
You're very welcome, Denny,
and keep in mind...
if you have any problems,
talk to me, and I will help you.
- Awesome. Thanks,Johnny.
- Let's go eat, huh?
- Come on. Let's go.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Let's go, huh? I'm starving.
- [ Chattering ]
So, how's Johnny?
So, how's Johnny?
- He didn't get his promotion.
- Oh. Is he disappointed?
Quite a bit.
He got drunk last night.
- [ Sighs ] And he hit me.
- He hit you?
He didn't know
what he was doing.
Are you okay?
- Well, I don't wanna marry him anymore.
- What?
Johnny's... okay,
but I found somebody else.
[ Chuckles ]
Lisa. This isn't right.
You're living with one guy,
and you're sleeping with another guy?
I'm doing what I wanna do.
Well, who is he?
His best friend.
And he lives in this building.
I can't believe
you're telling me this.
It's Mark, isn't it?
[ Exclaims ]
Lisa, you know what?
You're just thinking about yourself.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.
You've gotta be honest with Johnny.
I can't do that.
He would be devastated.
If you care so much for him,
why cheat on him?
Look, I really don't know
what to do.
I love Mark.
I don't have any more feelings
forJohnny.
[ Sighs ] Johnny is so excited
about this wedding.
- I know.
- You've got to tellJohnny.
No guilt trips.
You don't feel guilty
about this at all?
No. I'm happy.
[ Sighs ]
Something awful is gonna happen.
Please don't tell anybody.
[ Sighs ]
Don't worry. You can trust me.
Don't worry. You can trust me.
- [ Door Opens ]
- Your secret is safe with me.
Hello, Michelle. I heard you.
What secret?
- It's between us women.
- Hi,Johnny.
Did you get a new dress?
Um, well,
I guess I'd better be going.
Uh, I'll just
talk to you guys later?
Excuse me.
Lisa, remember what I told you.
[ Mouths Words ]
[ Door Closes ]
- What's she talking about?
- It's girl talk. I just told you that.
I never hit you.
You shouldn't have any secrets from me.
I'm your future husband.
You sure about that?
Maybe I'll change my mind.
- Don't talk like that. What do you mean?
- What do you think?
Women change their minds
all the time.
[ Laughing ]
You must be kidding, aren't you?
I don't wanna talk about it.
I'm gonna go upstairs
and wash up and go to bed.
How dare you
talk to me like that?
- You should tell me everything.
- I can't talk right now.
Why, Lisa? Why, Lisa?
Please talk to me.
Please!
You're part of my life.
You're everything.
I could not go on
without you, Lisa.
You're scaring me.
You are lying!
I never hit you!
You are tearing me apart, Lisa!
- Why are you so hysterical?
- Do you understand life?
Do you?
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be all right.
You drive me crazy.
Good night,Johnny.
Don't worry about it.
I still love you.
Good night, Lisa.
- Hey,Johnny. What's goin'on, man?
- Hi, Mike. What's new?
- Hey,Johnny. What's goin'on, man?
- Hi, Mike. What's new?
- How you doing?
- Um, actually,Johnny...
- I- I got a little bit of a tragedy on my hands.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah. Me and Michelle,
we were-we were makin' out.
Uh, at your place.
- [ Chuckles ]
- And, uh, Lisa and Claudette sort of,uh...
walked in on us
in the middle of it.
- That's not the end of the story.
- Go on. I'm listening.
We're goin' at it, and, um,
I get out of there as fast as possible.
I get my pants, I get my shirt,
and I get outta there.
Then about halfway down the stairs,
I realize that I-
I have misplaced-
I've forgotten something.
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh, my underwear.
- [ Laughing ] I know.
- So, I come back to get it,
and I pretend I need a book.
I'm lookin' for my book. I reach in,
put the underwear in my pocket...
and sort of slide out real quick.
Claudette- She saw it
sticking out of my pocket.
She pulls it out, and
she's showing everybody me underwears.
You must be kidding.
Underwear- I got the picture.
- Yeah. I don't know what-
- That's life.
- Hey,Johnny. Hey, Mike.
- Oh, hey, Denny.
- What's up, buddy?
- Wanna play some football?
I gotta go see Michelle in a little bit
to make out with her.
- I'm sorry.
- Come on.
- Come on. Football.
- You think I'm-All right. Whatever.
- Let's go for it.
- I'm goin' out.
- All right.
- Yeah. Sorry you had to see that.
- I'm not sorry.
- [ Laughing ]
- Your turn. Almost as much as I was.
- Studying, right?
- Come on, guys.
- I don't study like that.
- He doesn't.
- [ Laughing ]
- [ Yawns ]
- Denny, what's up?
- What's up, Mark?
- Hi, Mark.
- Catch it.
- Not too much. What about you guys?
- Uh-
- [ Denny ] He's just tellin'us
about an underwear issue.
- Dude, it's-
- Underwear? What's that?
- It's embarrassing, man. I don't wanna get into it.
- Underwear, man?
- [ Grunts ]
- You okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.
- Do you want to see a doctor?
- No. No, no, no.
I'm good.
I'm all right. I'm fine.
- I'll take him home.
- Why don't you take him home?
Mike, listen. If you need anything,
call me. Anytime, all right?
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.
- See you guys.
- See you guys.
[ Sighs ]
Let's go home, Denny.
You look really tired today, Mom.
Are you feeling okay?
- I didn't get much sleep last night.
- Why not? What's wrong?
- You remember my friend, Shirley Hamilton?
- Uh-huh.
She wants to buy a new house...
and so I asked Johnny if he could
help her with the down payment.
All he can tell me is,
""It's an awkward situation.''
I expected your husband
to be a little more generous.
- He's not my husband.
- I know.
ButJohnny is part of our family.
Mom, I don't loveJohnny anymore.
Ohh.
[ Sighs ]
I don't even like him.
- I had sex with someone else.
- You can't be serious.
- You don't understand.
- Who?
Who is it?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- You don't want to talk about it.
- Then why did you bring it up in the first place?
- I don't know.
You don't know.
If you think I'm tired today,
wait till you see me tomorrow.
Coming to the party?
Sure. I suppose so.
How can they say this about me?
How can they say this about me?
I don't believe it.
I'll show them.
I'll record everything.
I don't understand women.
Do you, Peter?
What man does?
- What's the problem?
- They never say what they mean.
And they always play games.
Okay, um, what do you mean?
I have a serious problem with Lisa.
Um, I don't think she's faithful to me.
In fact, I know she isn't.
Lisa? Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. I overheard a conversation
between Lisa and her mother.
What should I do, Peter?
- This is Lisa we're talking about?
- Yeah.
- I don't know what to say.
- But you are a psychologist.
Do you have some advice?
It's a complicated situation,Johnny.
I mean, you're my friend, and I don't
wanna get between you and Lisa.
But look, if you want to,
you should confront her.
I can't confront her.
I want to give her a second chance.
After all, she's my future wife.
You know what they say-
Love is blind.
You got a lot of faith in Lisa.
Sometimes life gets complicated.
The unexpected can happen.
- When it does, you just gotta deal with it.
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
Did you hear the door?
Yeah. I did.
- Oh, hi, Mark. Come in.
- Oh, hey,Johnny.
Hey, Peter.
We're just talking about women.
Women, man.
Women just confuse me.
[ Sighs ]
I have a girl, but she's married.
She's very attractive.
It's just- It's driving me crazy.
Why didn't you mention this before?
Is it anyone I know?
- No, man. You don't know her.
- Can I meet her?
I don't think so.
It's an awkward situation.
You mean she's too old, or you think
I would take her away from you?
- [ Chuckles ]
- Huh?
No.
I have my own problems.
Tell me about your problems,Johnny.
Peter, you always
play psychologist with us.
Look, I'm just your friend,
and I'm just worried about you.
Lisa's teasing me about whether
we are going to get married or not.
And we didn't make love
in a while...
and I don't know what to do.
[ Peter ]
You never really know. I mean-
Look, you should tell her
about your feelings. Okay?
You shouldn't hide 'em.
You two have been together forever.
- You can work out anything
as long as you talk about it.
- Not always.
People are people. Sometimes
they just can't see their own faults.
I'm thinking of moving to a bigger place,
man. I'm making some good money.
You should tell her the truth.
You're doing this for your girl, right?
You're right, Peter.
[ Laughs ]
- Is she getting a divorce, Mark?
- You guys are too much.
Hey, are you running
Bay to Breakers this year?
- I am, sure.
- No, I'm not doing it this year.
[ Laughs ] Chicken, Peter.!
You'rejust a little chicken.!
Cheep!
Cheep-cheep-cheep cheep!
- [ Continues Mocking ]
- Who are you calling a chicken?
I just don't like all the weirdos.
There's too many weirdos there.
I-I-I don't mind.
Mark, do you remember the one
with the big tits? The blondie one?
- How about the one with the
bridal gown, with the sign?
- Oh, yeah- ""Can you marry me?''
[ Laughs ] I thought I would
take her up on it.
- I never ate so much.
- The barbecue chicken was delicious.
Rice. That was cool.
You guys prove my point-
You're both weird.
You guys wanna play cards?
No, we can't.
I expect Lisa any minute.
Come on, man.
Who's the king of the house?
You gotta establish these guidelines
before you get married.
How did you ever meet Lisa?
You never told us.
That's a very interesting story.
When I moved to San Francisco
with two suitcases, I didn't know anyone.
I have- I hit Y.M.C.A....
with a $2,000 check
which I couldn't cash.
- Why not?
- Well, because it was an out-of-state bank.
Anyway, I was working
as a busboy in a hotel...
and, uh-
uh, she was sitting...
drinking her coffee.
She was so beautiful.
And I say ""Hi'' to her.
That's how we met.
So, what's the interesting part?
Well, the interesting part is
that on our first date, she paid for dinner.
- What? No tips from your job?
- Whatever.
Do you guys
wanna eat something?
Hey, guys. What's going on?
- Oh, hey, Lisa.
- Hi, Lisa.
- Where's Johnny?
- In the kitchen.
I gotta go.
I didn't mean to chase you off.
Wish you'd stick around for a while.
I gotta work early.
See ya.
- Did you get your wedding gown yet?
- No. I've got plenty of time.
Are you sure you have plenty of time?
It's only a month away.
It'll be fine.
What are you so worried about?
Everything's okay.
Johnny doesn't seem very excited.
Is there a problem?
There's no problem.
Why do you ask?
I just want you and Johnny
to be happy.
I am happy.
Look, Denny, I need to talk toJohnny.
Okay? I'll see you later.
- Okay. Tell him I said hello?
- Yeah.
Hey, Mark. What's up?
Oh, hey, Peter.
It's a good place
to think up here, isn't it?
What, man?
You wanna put me on the clock?
What the hell is that?
You want some?
It's good, bro.
You know I don't smoke that stuff.
[ Sighs ]
You look depressed.
I got this sick feeling
in my stomach, man.
I did something awful.
I don't think I can forgive myself.
Tell me about it.
I just feel like-
like running...
killing myself.
Something crazy like that.
Why are you
smoking that crap?
It's no wonder you can't think straight.
It's gonna screw with your head.
It's none of your business, man.
You think you know everything.
- You don't know shit.
- Wait a second. Who do you think you are?
You're acting like a kid.
Just grow up.
Who you calling a kid?
Fuck you!
Just chill out, Mark.
I'm just trying to help.
You're having an affair with Lisa,
aren't you?
- Am I wrong?
- What?
What are you, nuts?
[ Grunts ]
Sorry.
I'm sorry, man.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Let's just talk
about your problem.
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah.
Goddamn it, man. Fuck!
Why do you want
to know my secret, man?
Well, you're right.
It's Lisa.
I don't know what to do, man.
I'm so depressed. It's all her fault.
She's such a manipulative bitch!
- How the hell did you let this happen?
- Fuck!
You know this is gonna ruin
your friendship with Johnny.
What were you thinking?
All right,you want my advice?
Sometimes life can get complicated...
and you've gotta be responsible.
So you don't see Lisa again, and you
definitely don't sleep with her again.
Just find yourself another girl.
She's a sociopath.
She only cares about herself.
She can't love anyone.
Whatever, Peter. Come on.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah. Thanks a lot.
Oh, thank you.
Yeah. Thanks a lot.
Oh, hi, Denny.
Nice tux!
You look great!
- You look really handsome.
- [ Laughs ]
- Your wedding picture's gonna look great.
- Oh, thanks.
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Hey, Peter. Come on in.
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Peter. Come in.
- You look good too.
- Sit down.
[ Doorbell Rings ]
- Whoa!
- [Johnny ] Whoa.!
Hey, guys.
- You like it?
- Yeah. It looks good.
You look great.
You look like a baby-face now.
You guys
wanna play some football?
In tuxes? No.
You gotta be kidding.
- Come on, Mark. Let's do it.
- I'm up for it.
- [ Laughs ]
-Johnny?
- Ask Peter.
- Come on, Peter!
- No, I don't think so.
- Please?
- Nope.
- Come on!
- No.
- [ All ] Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
Catch,Johnny! Whoo!
Yeah! Nice snag!
All right, Peter!
Here we go, Mark!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
- Ohh!
- Yeah!
- Catch, Mark!
- Go.
Go deep!
[ Grunts ]
Gee, Peter, you're clumsy.
All right, that's it. I'm done.
Great idea, Denny.
[ Groans ]
[ Woman ] I'm gonna get
a slice of cheesecake and a bottle of water.
I'll have a large peanut butter whip
with extra whipped cream, please.
- All right.
- And I'll take some cheesecake and a coffee.
Okay. Have a seat.
We'll have that right out for you.
Hi. How you doing?
What would you like?
- Can I get a bagel and an Americana?
- Great. Sure.
I'm gonna get a slice of cheesecake
and a bottle of water.
Sounds good. Have a seat.
We'll have that right out for you.
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi,Johnny. How are you?
- Good to see you. What would you like?
- Hot chocolate, please.
- What size?
- Medium, please.
- How about you?
- I'll have the mint tea.
- Medium also?
- Yeah.
Go sit down.
We'll be right there.
I'm so tired of girls' games.
What happened now, Mark?
Relationships never work.
I don't know why I waste my time.
What makes you say that?
It's not that easy,Johnny.
Well, you should be happy, Mark.
Yeah, I know. Life is too short.
- Oh, thank you, Susan.
- You're welcome.
How 'bout somethin'
like cheesecake?
- No.
- Not today.
It's real good. All right.
- How was work today?
- Oh, pretty good.
We got a new client,
and the bank will make a lot of money.
- What client?
- I cannot tell you. It's confidential.
- Aw, come on. Why not?
- No, I can't.
Anyway, how's your sex life?
I can't talk about it.
Why not?
- [ Susan ] Take your time.
- Oh, God, I have to run.
- Already?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- It's on me.
- See you, Mark.
- You wanna go jogging?
- Sure. What time?
- Golden Gate Park, 6:30.
- Right on.
- All right? See ya.
- Okeydokey, pal.
What's going on here?
I like you very much, Mark.
Come on.
Johnny's my best friend.
Just one more time.

How do you mean that?
I'm always ready... for you.

is put on my party dress.

I knew I could count on you.
Hi, Mark. X-Y-Z.
What are you talking about?
- Examine your zipper.
- [ Giggles ]
You guys are too much.
So, what can I do to help?
I gotta go.
[ Both Giggling ]
- Come on and help me move the coffee table.
- Okay.
What was he doing here?
Ah, he just brought by
some take-out.
What about his zipper?
What about his zipper?
Leave him alone.
He's a good guy.
Did you tellJohnny yet?
[ Sighs ]
No. Mark's his best friend.
Tricky, tricky.
You know,
I really loved Johnny at first.
Everything's changed.
I need more from life
than whatJohnny can give me.
Suddenly my eyes
are wide open...
and I can see everything so clearly.
I want it all.
You think you can
get it all from Mark?
If he can't give me what I want,
somebody else will.
Lisa, you're sounding
just like your mother.
You're being so manipulative.
So what? You can
learn something from me.
You have to take
as much as you can.
You have to live, live, live.
Don't worry about me.
I have everything covered.
Your point of view
is so different from mine.
Look, I don't wanna talk about it.
People are gonna be getting here soon,
and we have to finish.
Lisa.
I don't see what the big deal is.
Doesn't everybody
look out for number one?
Don't I deserve the best?
I couldn't do that.
You're too much for me, Lisa.
You know, you're not
such an angel yourself.
- Yeah, but we're not talking about me, are we?
- [ Both Giggling ]
Stop it!
Are you trying to ruin my party?

- When can we meet about that?
- We can talk about this tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.
- I can come in, like, in the late afternoon?
- Absolutely. 8:00?
Really? Right on. That's great.
Bye, Lisa.
Oh, hi, Claudette.
- Oh!
- Bye!
- Uh-huh!
- Hello, Mom. How are you?
I'm okay. How are you?
I'm fixing the apartment forJohnny's birthday,
but I'm really not into it.
Oh? Why not?
'Cause I'm in love with Mark,
notJohnny.
And here I am planning his party.
It's not right, Lisa.
I still think
you should marryJohnny.
Now,you can't live on love.
You need financial security.
But I'm not happy.
He still thinks
I'm gonna marry him next month.
He's a fool.
You expect to be happy.
I haven't been happy
since I married my first husband.
I didn't even want
to marry your father.
You never told me that.
Well, it's true.
All men are assholes.
Men and women use and abuse each other
all the time. There's nothing wrong with it.
Marriage has nothing
to do with love.
Johnny's okay, I suppose.
Actually...
I have him wrapped
around my little finger.
You should be happy then.
- But I don't love him.
- [ Sighs ]
Don't throw your life away
just because you don't love him.
That's ridiculous!
You need to grow up,
and you need to listen to me.
Okay.
Mom, I'll see you at the party.
- I just need to be alone right now.
- Mmm.
Bye-bye, my precious.

I'm in love with Mark.
How can you do this?
You make me sick.
- [ Laughing ]
- Hey!
Thank you, honey.
This is a beautiful party.
You invited all my friends.
Good thinking!
You're welcome, darling.
- You know how much I love you.
- I do.
[ Chuckles ]
It's getting really hot in here.
- Why don't we go back outside.
- Uh-huh.
Okay.
[Johnny Chuckles ]
[ Chattering, Laughing ]
Hey, everybody!
I have an announcement to make!
- We're expecting!
- [ Chattering, Exclaiming ]
That's great!
Hey! Thank you.
Lisa, I have to talk to you.
You have got to be honest
with Johnny.
I agree with that.
Look, I'm gonna tell him. Okay?
I just- I don't want
to ruin his birthday.
When is the baby due?
- There is no baby.
- What?
- What?
W-What are you talking about?
[ Sighs ]
I told him that
to make it interesting.
We're probably gonna
have a baby eventually anyway.
You're not gonna tellJohnny,
are you?
Lisa, are you feeling okay?
Because this is just
getting worse and worse.
I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb,
waiting for it to go off.
Me too. I mean,
there's no simple solution to this.
Don't worry. You guys worry
entirely too much about me.
We're not worried about you.
We're worried aboutJohnny.
You don't understand the psychological impact
of what you're doing here.
You're hurting yourself.
You're hurting our friendship.
I am not responsible forJohnny.
I'm through with that.
I'm changing.
I have the right, don't I?
People are changing all the time.
I have to think about my future.
What's it to you?
This is going to pull us all down.
It's gonna shake up
our group of friends.
It's gonna destroy our friendship, Lisa.
I don't think Mark really loves you.
I don't wanna talk about it!
Lisa, you're gonna have to face it.
I, for one, am gonna have a hard time
forgiving you if you don't.
Hey, everybody!
Let's go inside and eat some cake!
- That's a good idea.!
- [ Guests Chattering, Exclaiming ]
I don't understand you, Lisa.
[ Sighs ]
- Mmm!
- Mm-hmm.
- Mmm!
- Mm-hmm.
- Lisa looks hot tonight.
- What do you mean, ""hot''?
- Sorry about what happened.
- That's all right, darling.
I'll- I'll help.
Whose baby is it?
Is it mine?
No, of course not.
- How can you be sure?
-Just stop asking me stupid questions.
- Who the hell do you think you are?
-Just shut up!
What are you doing?
What's going on here?
- You really don't know, do you?
- Maybe I know more than you think I do, Mark.
- Shit! All right?
- What do you want from me?
Huh?
Stop! Stop! Stop it!
All right. All right!
Okay, folks everything is fine.
The fight is over.
I'm sorry, Mark.
Yeah. Me too.
Lisa, can-
Can you clean up here, please?
[ Exhales ]
What are you doing?
None of your business.
- You're my future wife. What are you doing, Lisa?
- Leave her alone, man.
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- Since when do you give me orders?
- Since Lisa changed her mind about you.
- [ Scoffs ]
Wake up, man!
What planet are you on?
I think you should
leave right now.
Don't spoil it.
We were just having fun.
Don't worry about it, man.
Don't touch me, motherfucker.
Get out.
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Leave my girl alone!
You two are acting like children.
- Son of a bitch.
- You're gonna ruin the party.
If you'd keep your girl satisfied,
she wouldn't come to me.
Get out of my house.
I'll kill you!
I'll break every bone
in your body.!
- Stop it!
- I'll kill you, you bastard!
- You couldn't kill me if you tried.!
- You betrayed me!
You're not good. You'rejust a chicken.
Cheep-cheep-cheep.!
-Johnny, chill out! It's over!
- Shut up!
- Cool it! It's over!
- Shut up!
It's not over.! Everybody betrayed me.!
I'm fed up with this world.!
I cleaned up the kitchen,
sweetheart...
so you don't have
to worry about that.
He still won't come
out of the bathroom.
Sweetheart, he's upset.
Now,Johnny is a sensible man.
He will come out. You will discuss this.
Everything is going to be okay.
I just think I should be
alone with him right now.
I understand, sweetheart.
I'm going to go home now.
- Bye-bye. You call me if you need me.
- I will.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Mm-hmm!
You can come out now,Johnny.
She's gone.
In a few minutes, bitch.
Who are you calling a bitch?
You and your stupid mother.
[ Beeping ]
[ Line Rings ]
- Hello?
- Hi, Mark.
I need to talk to you.
- What's going on?
- Don't worry aboutJohnny.
He's just being a big baby.
You know,
I love you very much.
I love you.
Why don't you
ditch this creep?
I don't like him anymore.
I know. He's not worth it.
Why don't I come up there
and be with you?
Sure, baby. Come on up.
I want your body.
You got it.
- I'm on my way. Bye.
- Bye.
Who were you talking to?
- Nobody.

We'll see about that.
[ Mark ]
Hello?
[ Lisa ]
Hi, Mark. I need to talk to you.
[ Mark ]
What's going on?
[ Lisa ] Don't worry aboutJohnny.
He's just being a big baby.
You know,
I love you very much.
You're the sparkle of my life.
I can't live without you. I love you.
You little tramp.
How could you do this to me?
I gave you
seven years of my life...
and you betray me.
- We'll see what else we have on this tape.
- No! Stop.
You little prick.
I put up with you for seven years.
You think you're an angel.
You're just like everybody.
I treat you like a princess,
and you stab me in the back.
I love you, and I did anything for you
to just please you.
And now you betray me!
How could you love him?
- [""Play'"Button Clicks ]
- [ Mark ] Why don't you just ditch this creep?
I don't like him anymore.
[ Lisa ]
I know. He's not worth it.
Why don't I come up there
and be with you?
[ Mark ]
Sure, baby. Come on up.
I want your body.
- [ Lisa ] You got it.
- [ Screams ]
Everybody betrayed me.
I don't have a friend in the world.
I'm leaving you,Johnny.
Get out. Get out!
Get out of my life!

happening to me? Why?
It's over.
God, forgive me.
Everything'll be all right.
[ Hammer Clicks ]
Good night,Johnny.
[ Gunshot Echoing ]
Wake up,Johnny!
Come on!
Is he dead?
[ Sobbing ]
My God. Mark, is he dead?
[ Gasps ]
Yes, he's dead.
Yes, he's dead!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
I've lost him,
but I still have you. Right?
Right?
You don't have me.
You'll never have me.
You killed him.
Mark, we're free to be together.
I love you.
I love you.
You tramp.
You killed him.
You're the cause of all of this.
I don't love you.
Get out of my life, you bitch!
- What's happening?
- Don't look, Denny.
Johnny's dead!
[ Whimpering ]
Wake up,Johnny! Please!
Please! It's not right!
It's not right.
[ Sobbing ]
Denny, he's in a better place.
Leave us!
Both of you leave.
As far as I'm concerned,you can
drop off the earth. That's a promise.
Just leave! Both of you!
Leave him, all right?
Let him be with him!
Why,Johnny?
Why? Johnny, why?
